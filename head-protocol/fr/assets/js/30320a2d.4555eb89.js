That is, how the system behaves given ClientInputs and what ServerOutputs are produced in response to it. See also the API reference for more details about individual API messages.

The cycle can be defined in the following four stages.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"rollbacks/index":{"id":"rollbacks/index","title":"Handling Rollbacks","description":"Rollbacks are an integral part of the behaviour of the Cardano chain: Any application built on top of Cardano and synchronizing its behaviour with the chain must be prepared to occasionally observe such rollbacks and Hydra is no exception.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"scalability":{"id":"scalability","title":"Scalability","description":"Any layer one blockchain suffers from a fundamental scalability limitation, this is fundamental because intentionally, transactions on a blockchain are validated by multiple parties to enhance the security of the protocol, this just consumes more time. For Cardano, this is reflected in the fact that blocks are created on average each 20 seconds, in this time, block creation, propagation, and validation happens. These limitations ultimately mean that state, the information that describes the system, can only change in discrete steps of this duration. Besides, given peak hours on the blockchain when there is a transaction queue, the time required to settle and confirm a transaction might also be higher, further increasing the effective settlement time. This is because your transaction might not be added to the next block, but the second or even third one coming.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"specification":{"id":"specification","title":"Specification","description":"The specification is currently written in LaTeX and can be","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"}}}')}}]);
