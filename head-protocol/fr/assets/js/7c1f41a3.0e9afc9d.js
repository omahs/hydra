It serves as\\npreparation for the monthly review meeting (see [slides][slides] and\\n[recording][recording]), where the team updates project stakeholders on recent\\ndevelopments to gather their feedback on proposed plans.\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\nThis month, the team released version 0.12.0, and the project\\n[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21/views/7) has been\\nslightly updated to focus 0.13.0 on network resiliency and bump incremental\\ncommit and decommit in priority:\\n\\n![The roadmap with features and ideas](./img/2023-08-roadmap.jpg) <small><center>The latest roadmap with features and ideas</center></small>\\n\\n#### Release 0.12.0\\n\\n- Support cardano-node 8.1.2\\n  - Updated client and Plutus versions\\n- Layer 2 protocol changes\\n  - Authenticated messages\\n  - Removed redundancy\\n- Event-sourced persistence\\n- New API endpoints\\n- Removal of _internal commit_ endpoint\\n- Improved off-chain transaction processing performance\\n- Security fixes\\n\\n- See [full release notes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/releases/tag/0.12.0) and a list of [delivered features](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/milestone/12?closed=1)\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n[Issues and pull requests closed since the last\\nreport](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2023-07-28..2023-08-29)\\n\\nThis month, the team worked on the following:\\n\\n#### Update the tutorial and include Mithril [#997](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/997)\\n\\nTo prepare for the Hydra master class at RareEvo, the team has taken the\\noriginally written tutorial for Hydra version 0.8.0 and updated it to work with the latest\\nversions.\\n\\nThe challenge was to write content that is both easily comprehensible and functional across a wide\\nrange of user platforms, including operating system and processor architectures.\\n\\nBesides writing the tutorial, it is essential to ensure that it is kept\\nup-to-date (eg, using continuous integration).\\n\\n#### Support cardano-node 8.1.2 [#1007](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1007)\\n\\nTo be able to use the latest Mithril snapshots to bootstrap a\\n`cardano-node` for the `hydra-node`, we needed to make some updates.\\n\\nThe `hydra-node` uses the `cardano-api` to establish a connection with the node using the node-to-client protocols. The format there has slightly changed (although versioned), necessitating an update to the version of `cardano-api` used within the `hydra-node`.\\n\\nThe way Haskell dependencies are managed required an adjustment of the versions for both `cardano-ledger` and `plutus`. These versions are used to construct our off-chain ledger and on-chain Hydra Head protocol scripts, respectively.\\n\\nAs a result, this process has proven to be more intricate than it might initially sound. However, it has ultimately resulted in enhancements to the efficiency of our on-chain scripts.\\n\\nTODO: how much?\\n\\n#### Event-sourced persistence [#913](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/913)\\n\\nWe want the hydra-node to be efficient in processing events to yield high\\nthroughput on processing transactions off-chain.\\n\\nWork done as part of [#186](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/186)\\nhas demonstrated that the primary bottleneck to faster transaction processing\\ninside the node was the state persistence logic, which simply overwrites the\\nfull state with whatever new state has been produced.\\n\\nFor that reason, we changed the persistent state to a sequence of events\\naccording to [ADR24](/adr/24). Persistence is now done incrementally by saving\\nonly the `StateChanged` deltas.\\n\\nAs a consequence, the first spike confirmed the following performance\\nimprovements: master ~300ms \u2192 spike ~6ms.\\n\\nTODO: what are the numbers on master before/after?\\n\\nFinally, this also opens up interesting possibilities for state observation in\\nclients.\\n\\n#### New API endpoints\\n\\nThis release also includes several additions to the Hydra API. We added the\\n[/cardano-transaction\\nendpoint](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1001) to submit a\\ntransaction to the layer 1 network. This feature improves developer experience as\\nHydra clients do not need direct chain access (eg, connect to `cardano-node`)\\nto be able to submit transactions.\\n\\nThe other new [/protocol-parameters\\nendpoint](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/989) serves the\\ncurrently configured protocol parameters used in `hydra-node`. This provides\\nmore flexibility when creating transactions for the head on the client side and\\navoids configuration or hard-coded values.\\n\\nOn top of this, we also included the hydra-node\\n[version](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/985) inside of the\\n`Greetings` message. This is very useful for debugging purposes and detecting\\npossible version mismatches.\\n\\n#### Removal of \'internal commit\' endpoint [#1018](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1018)\\n\\nIn the previous release, we made an announcement regarding the deprecation of committing to the head through the websocket command. Subsequently, we have taken steps to eliminate this client command, which in turn resulted in the removal of the _fuel_ markers that were previously used to mark the UTXO of the internal Hydra wallet meant for use in the Head.\\n\\nThis simplifies the setup needed to run the Head protocol and improves security\\nsince users can directly commit funds from their wallets without sending them to\\nthe Head operator beforehand.\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n#### Hydra master class at RareEvo\\n\\nWe were happy to run a Hydra master class session at RareEvo 2023. The session\\nattracted 30+ attendees for the introductory parts including a presentation on\\nHydra and Mithril. About 10-15 participants remained for the practical part and\\nfollowing discussion.\\n\\nWe also streamed the event live on Discord, but were not able to interact much\\nthere. The responses were positive though and we should be doing more things in\\nthe public on this #hydra-live channel.\\n\\nSeveral participants managed to use Mithril and synchronize a pre-production cardano-node; two teams effectively initiated Hydra heads, conducted fund transactions within them, and subsequently closed them. The major challenges, as expected, concerned installation and networking. In the future, we intend to ensure the availability of prebuilt binaries catering to a wider range of platforms.\\n\\n#### Catalyst Fund10\\n\\nThe team screened all the proposals mentioning Hydra and\\n[Mithril](https://mithril.network/doc/). We submitted 11 community reviews and\\nnoticed, in particular, the following proposals:\\n\\n- [Sundae Labs Hydra Ledger-only Mode](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/102138)\\n- [Sundae Labs Hydra Transaction Stream Plugin](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/102200)\\n- [Hydra as a B2B layer for DeFi - a white paper and an MVP](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/101626)\\n- [Decentralized Demeter.run - Federated Frontend Hosting - New revenue stream for SPOs](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/104411)\\n- [Mithril - Open-source contributor](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/105113)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe monthly review meeting for August 2023 was held on 2023-08-23 via Google\\nMeet with these [slides][slides] and the [recording][recording], \'broadcasting live from warm and sunny Colorado\'!\\n\\nIt has been an interesting and unusual month. Some of the team had been in\\nLongmont, CO to prepare for the RareEvo event and we used the chance to have the\\nmeeting in a hybrid setting with some IO stakeholders attending live on-site and\\nabout 20 community members online.\\n\\nThis time, the demo was about the updated tutorial and demonstrating the full\\nsetup of the cardano-node, opening a Hydra head on the pre-production network, and submitting\\ntransactions off-chain in 15 minutes!\\n\\nThe feedback we received included inquiries about the timing, method, and extent of the audit for the Head protocol. While we will have an internal audit, which is already\\nhelping us improve the protocol, there are no plans for a significant external audit with funding. We also had the chance to look into and learn about some Catalyst Fund10\\nproposals involving Hydra. Hopefully, some or all of them get funded and we are\\nlooking forward to testing the Hydrazoa concept, implementing the ledger-mode operation, enabling federated Heads, and achieving other objectives.\\n\\nAt the RareEvo event, we had the chance to meet and communicate with various people\\nfrom the community. This ranges from known Hydra collaborators to tech-savvy\\nstake pool operators, to representatives of successful applications running on\\nCardano for scaling purposes like [book.io](https://book.io/).\\n\\nAlso with a new full-time contributor on board, we are keen to add more\\nfunctionality while the first applications prepare to utilize Hydra in production\\non mainnet.\\n\\n[slides]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MrCeUsYb3FQk7aCwMZdQs8mc5BfLOIjkK9gcWzgDdDc/edit#slide=id.g1f87a7454a5_0_1392\\n[recording]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14pDsf0hDyh9HK8sCSMmkmT8gY8YxgOQ8/view"},{"id":"2023-09","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2023-09","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/master/docs/monthly/2023-09-monthly.md","source":"@site/monthly/2023-09-monthly.md","title":"September 2023","description":"This report summarizes the work on Hydra since August 2023.

To minimize the \'scope creep\' from this topic, the team has narrowed down the direct goal to improve the situation incrementally.\\n\\n* When detailing the design of incremental de-/commits, the feature was also split in two. Each of the features would have a different impact on the user experience and relates to other ideas:\\n\\n  * [Incremental commit #199](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/199) is a bit more complicated, but paves the way for directly open heads and could make [Always abortable head #699](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/699) redundant.\\n\\n  * [Incremental decommit #1057](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1057) is fairly straightforward and can be evolved into \'partial fanouts\', which solves similar problems as the [split-fanout #190](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/190) and [only signing closable snapshots #370](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/370) would address. Also, the [optimistic head closure #198](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/198) feature is closely related to this item.\\n\\n* Added a new feature to improve user journey of running the `hydra-node` by [removing the command line defaults #1064](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1064). This came out of prior [idea discussion #454](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/454) which highlights the life cycle of ideas and features on the Hydra project.\\n\\n## Cardano Scaling workshop in Nantes, France\\n\\nFrom 2023-09-12 to 2023-09-14, most of the _Scaling Tribe_ members, that is the two Hydra and Mithril teams, met for a three-day workshop in the beautiful French city of [Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes). This workshop was run following the [Open Space](https://openspaceworld.org/wp2/) technique which makes room for every participant to experiment and focus on what\'s of interest for them at the time while being engaging for the whole team. Here is a selection of topics covered that were most relevant to Hydra.\\n\\n### Aiken validator experiment\\n\\nAs part of thw workshop, we explored how hard it would be to implement one of\\nthe Hydra validators in `aiken`. After roughly two hours of work we had a\\n`hydra-node` running, tests passing and benchmarks of verifying one step in the\\nHydra protocol using aiken.\\n\\nThe `hydra-node` just uses the UPLC binary and its hash to construct\\ntransactions, we could rely on the same interface, with the difference that the\\nscript binary gets produced by `aiken`. Aiken does produce a socalled blueprint\\n`plutus.json` containing the contract. We staged that file into git and embedded\\nit into a Haskell interface to be able to reference the compiled script as\\n`SerialisedScript` from `hydra-node`.\\n\\nNext, we ported the simplest contract we have, namely the\\n[Commit](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/ec6c7a2ab651462228475d0b34264e9a182c22bb/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Commit.hs)\\nvalidator, [to\\nAiken](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/4ec572511fc13a526b85efce3aac556ae5bd007c/hydra-plutus/validators/commit.ak).\\nThis was fairly straight-forward and we test were passing after some fiddling\\nwith internal representations of data strctures (`plutus-tx` is encoding triples\\nas `Constr` data on-chain).\\n\\nThe results? A significant reduction in script size, cpu and memory usage on\\n`collect` and `abort` transactions - or in different words, [doubling the\\nsupported](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1072#issuecomment-1717644108)\\nnumber of parties in a Head. \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n### Shallow cardano-node experiment\\n\\nRunning a hydra-node requires running a cardano-node, and running a\\ncardano-node requires synchronisation with the chain and about 150\\ngigabytes of data to be downloaded and verified, which is a\\nsignificant barrier to quickly spin-up hydra-node and Hydra\\nHeads. Given a Hydra node does not need to look at the history of the\\nchain, a _Shallow_ cardano-node that can run without the full database\\nof immutable files would be fine, assuming we can retrieve a recent\\nstate of the chain with the same security guarantees than a fully\\nsynchronised chain. This is exactly what Mithril can provide!\\n\\nWe ran a small experiment, trying to start a cardano-node manually\\nremoving all but the last files from the _immutable DB_ and it worked\\nas long as one does not query the node for a block too old in the\\npast. This lead us to envision an improved user experience for\\ninstalling and running a hydra-node, by packaging it with a\\ncardano-node and a mithril-client to retrieve only the minimum needed\\nstate and be able to start a fully functioning hydra-node in minutes.\\n\\n### Other topics\\n\\n* We continued working on [Kupo x\\n  Hydra](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1078)\\n  integration, benefiting from the presence of Kupo\'s creator and\\n  former Hydra team member, Matthias Benkort\\n* We brainstormed possible synergies between the Hydra and Mithril\\n  projects, something that solidified into the desire to explore this\\n  concept of \\"Shallow node\\" and its integration within Hydra\\n* We discussed and clarified our new [Security Vulnerability\\n  Disclosure\\n  Policy](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1088)\\n* Discussing the idea of a joint documentation effort, we realised the\\n  existing documentation of both teams could be improved, for example\\n  by following a [Standard documentation\\n  framework](https://documentation.divio.com).\\n\\n## Hydra development\\n\\n[Issues and pull requests closed since the last\\nreport](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2023-08-29..2023-09-29)\\n\\nThis month, the team worked on the following:\\n\\n#### Network resilience to disconnects [#188](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/188)\\n\\nIf a Hydra node crashes, it can recover its state from disk thanks to the\\n[event-sourced persistency](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1000)\\nmechanism in place. But if a peer inside the head sends messages while the node\\nis down, these messages are lost for this node and this can well lead to the\\nhead being stuck.\\n\\nFor instance, in the following picture, we see that if Bob was down when Alice\\nacknowledged snapshot 10, then it will wait forever for this acknowledgement and\\nwill refuse to move forward with the head, making it stuck.\\n\\n![Head stuck because of lost message](./img/2023-09-head-stuck.png) <small><center>Head stuck because of lost message</center></small>\\n\\nHydra is designed to deal with non-cooperative peers in a very safe way:\\nclose the head! And this situation could be generalized as a non cooperative\\npeer situation. So the safe move is to just close the head.\\n\\nBut practically speaking, closing the head every time a node restarts or a network\\nconnection is interrupted can lead to an operations nightmare. So the question we\'re\\nexploring is, can we distinguish between non cooperative peer or just transient\\ncommunication issue?\\n\\n* {ADR 27)[https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/docs/adr/2023-09-08_027-network-resilience.md]\\ngives details about our current strategy\\n* [#1074](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1074) is a first implementation of this strategy\\n* [#1080](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1080) should specify the resulting network protocol so that others could implement compatible hydra nodes\\n\\n#### Incremental commits and decommits [#199](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/199)\\n\\nIn the beginning of this month, some progress on incremental commits and\\ndecommits was made. An early\\n[experiment](https://twitter.com/ch1bo_/status/1696067253089743289) about the\\noff-chain / node logic showed that we can re-use the `/commit` validator and\\nmotivated design work on the feature items.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the protocol extension was split into two items [Incremental\\ncommits #199](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/199) and\\n[Incremental decommits\\n\\n# [1057](<https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1057>). Both items contain\\n\\nhigh-level description, interaction outline and a first design of the on-chain\\nvalidators which is currently getting discussed by the Hydra contributors and\\nresearchers.\\n\\nEspecially the incremental commit is not trivial as the interaction between\\nlayer 1 and layer 2 is quite intricate. Observing a deposit on the Cardano\\nmainchain may not be seen by all parties at the same time and this should not\\nlock up the layer 2 process of transactions, while premature usage of committed\\nfunds is to be avoided. On the other hand, each step in the protocol needs to be\\nsecure in presence of an adversary and unlocking of committed funds must always\\nbe possible.\\n\\nOnce this validator design is clear, we can get started implementing one or both\\nof the features to enable more flexible usage of the Hydra head protocol.\\n\\n#### Refactored chain state [#1049](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1049)\\n\\nFollowing up the implementation of ADR#24, this marks the first enhancement in\\na series of refinements, and our goal was optimization.\\n\\nWe eliminated the need for recursive types in persisted chain states,\\ntransitioning to a non-empty history model, preserving full backward\\ncompatibility with existing systems.\\n\\nImportantly, throughout this refactor, we\'ve kept the interface between the\\nchain and logic layers entirely unchanged. This ensures a smooth transition and\\nseamless integration with existing components.\\n\\nOne of the notable advantages of this refactor is a reduced persistence\\nfootprint. We now store individual points of the chain state, enhancing storage\\nefficiency.\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n#### Open source contributions\\n\\nThis month some open source contributions were received, and the team was able to\\ncontribute back to one project:\\n\\n* Hydra: Lightning network-style payments [use case](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/unstable/use-cases/payments/lighting-network-like-payments/) write-up by [@k-solutions](https://github.com/k-solutions)\\n* Aiken: Started an emacs [aiken-mode](https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken-mode) by @ch1bo (triggered by our experiments)\\n* Hydra: Small [fix in the docs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1042) by [@caike](http://github.com/caike) (from RareEvo workshop)\\n\\n#### Current scaling use cases being tracked\\n\\n##### Hypix\\n\\n* An update of hydraw with improved usability to stimulate user engagement\\n* A showcase for Hydra, with an option to productize\\n\\n##### Book.io\\n\\n* A Web3 marketplace for tokenized digital eBooks and Audiobooks\\n* Requires NFT minting and distribution at scale (for each copy/instance of a book)\\n* Opened a discussion to investigate possible approaches to scaling their operations on Cardano\\n\\n##### Midnight\\n\\n* DUST airdrop and side-chain operation\\n\\n##### SingularityNet\\n\\n* A Web3 marketplace for AI services offered and consumed through a pay-per-use API\\n* Discussion ongoing about porting an existing Ethereum solution to Cardano\\n* A chance to build on previous Hydra Pay efforts and upgrade the design to support unidirectional micropayments channels\\n\\n##### SundaeLabs\\n\\n* Sundae proposed a ledger-only mode of Hydra, modelled on Gummiworm (the protocol used by SundaeSwap)\\n* https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/102138\\n\\n##### Emurgo\\n\\n* Initial discussions to evaluate building a payments channel network using Hydra\\n* Could leverage work done on Hydra Pay by Obsidian\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe monthly review meeting for August 2023 was held on 2023-09-20 via Google\\nMeet with these [slides][slides] and the [recording][recording].\\n\\nThis concludes yet another fully-packed month, this time not only\\nfocusing on Hydra but also encompassing Mithril and the broader goal of\\nsupporting Cardano\'s scaling effort to the best of our\\nability. Meeting and working together in person demonstrated once\\nmore, if this were needed, how much a small group of highly motivated\\npeople can achieve. It also fueled our desire and consolidated our\\nvision of being a small group of engineers with a clear _purpose_,\\nscratching our \\"own itch\\", contributing to the whatever projects and\\ntools is needed and best for the job at hand, relentlessly prototyping\\nand experimenting collectively to find the best solutions solving\\nactual people\'s problems.\\n\\nIt is also worth mentioning that Catalyst\'s Fund 10 outcome shoudl\\nresult in more contributions to Hydra (and hopefully Mithril!) in the\\nnear term.\\n\\n[slides]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YAWR4pz1gG2dwtGvm5KOAHtrjRcchPLUKhDA16u10ps\\n[recording]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X8QnmG9gddR-t2V6F2oE7bYCYAEs2RPe/view"},{"id":"2023-07","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2023-07","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/master/docs/monthly/2023-07-monthly.md","source":"@site/monthly/2023-07-monthly.md","title":"July 2023","description":"This report summarizes the work on Hydra since June 2023.

Our goal is to facilitate the opening of a distributed Hydra head with two nodes on a testnet within just a few minutes.\\n\\n  - **Build a basic head explorer**: We have previously experimented with the explorer, and now we are looking to set it up for the long term. The goal is not only to assess Hydra adoption but also to provide a valuable tool for DApp developers. Additionally, we aim to create a visualization that end users can use to answer important questions, such as \'who is running this head?\'\\n\\n- Drive adoption :blue_heart:\\n\\n  - **Deliver the first version of HydraNow to mainnet**:\\n    It\'s important that the very promising use case of payments using\\n    Hydra is made available to first users on mainnet. As a concrete example, this would be\\n    a mobile application \'HydraNow\', which uses a `hydra-pay` service to enable\\n    peer-to-peer payment channels.\\n\\n  - **Enable uni-directional payment channels**: This will expand the\\n    capabilities of any payment channel created using Hydra, allowing deposits and\\n    withdrawals while keeping the head open.\\n\\nWork packages related to these items appear on the technical\\nroadmap (especially [in this view](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21/views/26)) and in our community activities.\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\nThis month, the team released version 0.11.0, which shifts the way Hydra clients\\nneed to interact with the hydra-node when committing funds. The project\\n[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21) was also updated\\nto reflect the latest developments and ideas from the starmap:\\n\\n![The roadmap without idea items](./img/2023-07-roadmap-ex-ideas.png) <small><center>The roadmap without idea items</center></small>\\n\\n#### Release 0.11.0\\n\\n- Completes the layer 2 ledger isomorphism with timed transaction support\\n\\n- Adds commit from external wallets API, which allows to:\\n\\n  - Commit multiple UTXO\\n  - Commit from scripts\\n  - Commit directly from any key\\n\\n- Deprecated: Internal commits via the WebSocket API\\n\\n- See [full release notes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/releases/tag/0.11.0) and a list of [delivered features](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/milestone/11?closed=1)\\n\\n#### Notable updates\\n\\n- Two new items \\\\__elevated_ from user ideas and improved the API capabilities:\\n\\n  - The [ability to read protocol parameters via API #735](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/735)\\n  - The ability to[submit layer 1 transactions through hydra-node #966](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/966)\\n\\n- [Removing commit from internal wallet #954](Submit layer 1 transactions through\\n  hydra-node#954) is a consequence of deprecating this functionality in the\\n  previous 0.11.0 release. This will make the code base and documentation\\n  cleaner as there will be only one way to commit funds to a head.\\n\\n- The first new item derived from the starmap is to [Update tutorial and include\\n  Mithril #997](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/997). The\\n  tutorial is already a bit outdated, this will slim it down and incorporate\\n  Mithril to get the fastest (secure) bootstrap possible of a `hydra-node`.\\n\\n- As a result of focusing on the very concrete use case of payments for mainnet\\n  deployment (and hence 1.0.0 release), multiple items need to (and can) get\\n  reprioritized to match the requirements of this use case.\\n\\n![The latest roadmap with features and ideas](./img/2023-07-roadmap.png) <small><center>The latest roadmap with features and ideas</center></small>\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n[Issues and pull requests closed since last report](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2023-06-22..2023-07-28)\\n\\nThis month, the team worked on the following:\\n\\n#### Authenticate network messages [#727](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/727)\\n\\nThe Hydra Head protocol paper states:\\n\\n> Each party then establishes pairwise authenticated channels to all other parties.\\n\\n[Hydra: Fast Isomorphic State Channels, p.14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299.pdf)\\n\\nGuaranteeing the authenticity and integrity of the messages received from one\'s peers is critical to the security of the Head protocol. Initially, we considered deferring this responsibility to the transport layer, for example, leaving it to Hydra node operators to use TLS or other encrypted channels to communicate with their peers. However, this introduced an additional and unnecessary operational burden on operators.\\n\\nIt appeared simple enough to reuse the existing Hydra keys (using Ed25519\\ncurve), which need to be passed to the node, to:\\n\\n- _sign_ all messages sent to peers\\n- _verify_ all messages received from peers\\n\\nThe net benefit of this feature is to increase the life expectancy of a head,\\npreventing some forms of _denial of service_ attacks or wrongly configured nodes\\nthat would lead to a _stalled head_.\\n\\n#### ReqSn only sends transaction IDs [#728](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/728)\\n\\nThis feature aligns the current implementation better with the original paper, as it requests snapshots using only the transaction identifiers, rather than the full transactions.\\n\\nThe motivation to implement this feature came from different directions:\\n\\n- Improve the performance of the protocol by reducing bandwidth usage\\n- Make it possible to have \'atomic\' transaction sets submitted\\n  ([#900](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/900)),\\n- Prevent \'front-running\' from the current leader which, in the previous\\n  implementation, could inject arbitrary (but valid) transactions that peers had\\n  never seen before into a snapshot.\\n\\n`ReqSn`\'s snapshots now contain only the list of transaction IDs and each\\nhydra-node validates the snapshot by resolving those ideas against the set of\\ntransactions they have seen (through `ReqTx`). A consequence is that this\\nintroduces the possibility of space leak in the event a submitted valid\\ntransaction never gets included in a snapshot, but this should not be\\na problem in practice.\\n\\nNote that the\\n[specification](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/core-concepts/specification)\\nhas been updated to reflect this change.\\n\\n#### GitHub security advisories\\n\\nThere was a bug in the multi-signature verification which could compromise\\noff-chain security of a Hydra Head protocol. Although the fix was quite simple, we\\ndecided to use a new GitHub feature to create the first [GitHub security\\nadvisory](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-c8qp-cv4h-vcc4)\\nfor Hydra.\\n\\nThe process creates a separate GitHub repository where potential security issues\\ncould be discussed privately (between the reporter and the maintainers) since\\npotential attackers should not be aware of any issues until they are fixed. The\\nteam scored this issue using CVSS (The Common Vulnerability Scoring System), the\\nscore was moderate (5.5), and they didn\'t request a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities\\nand Exposures) for this (yet).\\n\\nThe process overall works well, but Hydra CI is not checking the builds in these\\nprivate, one-off forks so there is a risk of merging code that doesn\'t compile.\\n\\n#### Moving to GHC 9.2.7 [#841](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/841)\\n\\nGHC 9.2 series have been around for more than a year and the whole Cardano ecosystem is gradually moving to use this new compiler version. Moreover, GHC 8.10.7 does not work reliably on aarch64 architectures, eg Mac M1/M2.\\n\\nMoving to this new version entailed some significant changes in the code and also in the Plutus scripts:\\n\\n| Name     | After (bytes) | Before (bytes) | \u0394size |\\n| -------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----- |\\n| \u03bdInitial | 4289          | 4621           | - 7%  |\\n| \u03bdCommit  | 2124          | 2422           | - 12% |\\n| \u03bdHead    | 9185          | 8954           | + 3%  |\\n| \u03bcHead    | 4149          | 4458           | -7%   |\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n### Hydra master-class\\n\\nAs already mentioned above in our starmap update, we aim to have an educational session at the upcoming Rare Evo event:\\n\\n> Whether you are building decentralized applications which need to be fast and scale well, or you are creating infrastructure for other builders on Cardano, we will show you how to use Hydra to make your applications and platforms utilize fast off-chain transaction processing via the Hydra Head protocol.\\n>\\n> In this session you will learn what Hydra is all about, how to build scalable applications in a live coding session, get to know the hydra-pay and hydra-auction projects, and be guided through exercises to get your hands on these APIs and early SDKs.\\n\\nWe are currently putting together a detailed outline and will send out\\ncommunications on how to register for this exclusive session within the next 1-2\\nweeks. Stay tuned.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe monthly review meeting for May was held on 2023-07-26 via Google Meet with\\nthese [slides][slides] and here is the [recording][recording].\\n\\nAlthough we had planned an awesome demo for this month\'s review meeting, showcasing a Hydra head hack without the authenticated messages feature, we encountered some live demo problems (lesson learned: always record a backup!). While we might present it next time, this situation emphasizes the need for continuous improvement in developer and user experiences.\\n\\nWe haven\'t received many questions on our journey to further mature the Hydra software stack to support various use cases building on it. However, the recently kicked-off Catalyst Fund10 sparked a nice discussion on how to handle all these great new ideas while being mindful not to fragment the scaling efforts too much.\\n\\nOpen protocols mean that new ideas can be incorporated not only into the various\\ncode bases, but also in the specification and standards which ensure\\ninteroperability. We discussed means to ensure adherence to standards in a\\nlight-weight agile way and the challenges of educating potential contributors in\\nspecification-driven development.\\n\\nNext month we\'ll be at RareEvo, but might have the monthly just before in a\\nhybrid session from Colorado. Until then, we\'ll make Hydra trivial to use and\\nget started on our new objectives.\\n\\n[slides]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CQYAFztRcqofN6sbowg37QuXQ-DQU4NcDmoMghS36B8\\n[recording]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ANZ3efuxgXpYK94EBWxZLR9TtN7voru/"},{"id":"2023-06","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2023-06","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/master/docs/monthly/2023-06-monthly.md","source":"@site/monthly/2023-06-monthly.md","title":"June 2023","description":"This report summarizes the work on Hydra since May 2023.

Identified a\\n  bottleneck, groomed and planned a follow-up performance improvement feature\\n  for [Event sourced persistence\\"\\n  #913](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/913)\\n\\n- Plan to release 0.11.0 without [Authenticate network messages\\n  #727](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/727) to deliver enabling\\n  featues earlier.\\n\\n- API improvements and exploring batched transactions on L2 showed that [ReqSN\\n  only sends transaction IDs\\n  #728](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/728) is in demand,\\n  front-loads further API changes and is estimated to be a low-hanging fruit.\\n\\n- Reprioritized items in `<= 1.0.0` column, to do items with on-chain protocol\\n  impact earlier and not much feedback has been received on snapshotting items. In\\n  fact, if [Support larger # of UTXO via split-fanout\\n  #190](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/190) is done slightly\\n  differently, that should avoid some of the problems of impossible to finalize\\n  snapshots.\\n\\n![The latest roadmap with features and ideas](./img/2023-06-roadmap.png) <small><center>The latest roadmap with featuresand ideas</center></small>\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n[Issues and pull requests closed since last\\nreport](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2023-05-24..2023-06-22)\\n\\nThis month, the team worked on the following:\\n\\n#### Commits with multiple UTXO [#774](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/774)\\n\\nOne of the early adopting projects is exploring how to move scripts from layer 1\\nto layer 2. For that purpose, it was necessary to not only commit the actual\\nscript UTXO, but also a \\"regular\\" UTXO holding only ada to be used as collateral\\n(the `cardano-ledger` always requires collateral although it would not be\\nnecessary on a layer 2).\\n\\nTo enable this, the specification and on-chain protocol needed updating. Before\\na protocol participant could commit zero or one UTXO, which changed now to a\\nlist of UTXO. As the specification is now [part of the\\nrepository](/monthly/2023-04#versioned-docs-and-specification), it could be kept\\nconsistent within the same pull request.\\n\\nDespite being a **breaking change**, leading to new Hydra script hashes to be\\npublished and used starting with version 0.11.0, this change was suprisingly\\neasy to do and demonstrated the amenability of the Head protocol and the system\\narchitecture.\\n\\n#### Commits from external wallet [#215](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/215)\\n\\nThe team started to mark _fuel_ some time ago as it was an easy workaround to\\ndistinguish UTXOs that can be committed into a head apart from regular outputs\\nholding ada to pay for fees - the so-called _fuel_. However, this required users\\nto \\"send funds\\" they want to commit first to the `hydra-node`s internal wallet\\nand involved additional steps in tagging such outputs with a special datum hash\\n\\nTo commit from external wallets, a new API endpoint was introduced for the\\npurpose of _drafting_ a commit transaction. The clients would request such draft\\ntransaction by sending a POST request to `/commit` and the `hydra-node` would\\nrespond with a transaction already authorized by the internal wallet. If the\\ncommit involved user funds (empty commits are still possible), then the client\\napplication would need to sign the transaction using the corresponding signing\\nkey. Also, submitting this transaction has shifted from `hydra-node` to the\\nclient.\\n\\nThis removes direct custody of `hydra-node` over user funds since clients can\\nnow use whatever key they own, not known to the `hydra-node`, to do a commit\\nstep and no single `hydra-node` has access to user funds used in the Head\\nprotocol.\\n\\nWithin this work package, _marking fuel_ became deprecated and all UTXOs owned\\nby the internal wallet are considered fuel. Fuel marking wil be completely\\nremoved in the future. Furthermore, a good old HTTP-based API is now used\\nfor the new query (so far it was only WebSocket-based), which prompts a\\npotential shift to using OpenAPI as API specification since AsyncAPI does not\\ndescribe synchronous requests well.\\n\\n#### Benchmark performance of Hydra Head [#186](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/215)\\n\\nLow confirmation time is a key feature of Hydra Head protocol and is\\nneeded for some use cases. The existing end-to-end \\nbenchmarks have been revived and tailored for a _baseline scenario_, one with a\\nsingle hydra-node and a single client. While this scenario is not\\nrepresentative of target deployments, it\'s interesting as it gives us\\nan upper bound on the performance of a Hydra Head network.\\n\\nThe results have been somewhat disappointing, and further investigations lead to a few insights:\\n\\n- There was a misconfiguration in the RTS of the hydra-node executable\\n  which was therefore not taking advantage of parallelism\\n- We identified the main bottleneck to be persistence of the node\'s\\n  state, which is currently done by overwriting a single file with the\\n  JSON content of the _full_ state on _state change_ which is pretty\\n  inefficient. As a consequence, the team will work on improving the\\n  persistence strategy as described in [this\\n  ADR](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/940)\\n- More benchmarks:\\n  - The aforementioned [End-to-end benchmarks](/benchmarks/end-to-end-benchmarks),\\n  - [Ledger Micro-benchmarks](/benchmarks/ledger) as a comparison basis.\\n\\n#### Operating hydra nodes\\n\\nAs a \\"dogfooding\\" exercise, the Hydra team is operating a Hydra Head\\non mainnet on top of which is running our `hydraw` application. \\nThe Head protocol got stuck a couple of times and\\npost-mortem investigations lead to a few improvements in how to\\noperate a hydra-node and network:\\n\\n- Better reporting on the version of executable `hydra-node` and\\n  `hydra-tui` which now report the Git SHA1 at which they were built\\n- Reduction in the volume of logs emitted by hydra-node by removing\\n  some chatty network-related logs and using ids to link `Begin/End`\\n  pairs\\n- Rework the\\n  [log-filter](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/35f2964ba6d4a780a5f8e669f1afce565a492cec/hydra-cluster/exe/log-filter/Main.hs#L34)\\n  tool to provide timings for various events and effects keyed by\\n  transactions\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n#### Hydra hackathon / workshop\\n\\nThe Hydra team is considering holding a workshop at/around Rare Evo at the end\\nof August and is in contact with the event teams at IOG and the Rare Evo\\norganizers. The concrete format, scope and agenda is still a bit unclear as we\\nare contemplating whether to do a workshop/tutorial style or rather a\\nintroduction + challenge setting event. If it does not work out for Rare Evo, we\\nwill find another event or do it ourselves.\\n\\nIf you are reading this and would be interested in joining such an event please\\ndrop us a line on [discord](https://discord.gg/Qq5vNTg9PT) or DM\\n[@ch1bo](https://twitter.com/ch1bo_)! Ideally along with some thoughts on\\npreferred format or what you would be interested in.\\n\\n#### Hydra for Auctions contributions and closing of project\\n\\nOne of the Hydra lighthouse projects is slowly coming to an end. The\\ncollaboration project between IOG and MLabs on using Hydra for auctions is\\ncurrently finalizing documentation and creating demonstration running the whole\\nthing on a public testnet. Although the demo video was not available at the copy\\ndeadline of this report, watch this space for more about this next\\nmonth.\\n\\nThe project yielded multiple github issues containing ideas and sparked great\\ndiscussions on improving Hydra like [reported last\\nmonth](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/monthly/2023-05#hydrozoa-850). It is\\nalso the first project which demonstrates how to move smart contracts from the\\nlayer 1 (L1) to the layer 2 (L2)! Overall it is a great example of establishing\\ncrucial state on L1 and achieving scalability through Hydra as L2.\\n\\nThe code is fully open source and available on Github\\n[hydra-auction](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction/).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe monthly review meeting for May was held on 2023-06-21 via Google Meet with\\nthese [slides][slides] and here is the [recording][recording].\\n\\nIt was a fairly straight-forward month and consequently unexciting review meeting\\nthis month. Unfortunately, we could not release 0.11.0 yet, but we wanted to get\\nthe quite significant change of supporting commits from external wallets done\\nfirst. This feature in particular was more involved than expected, but as the\\ndemonstration in the meeting showed, we are in the final stages of getting this\\nover the line.\\n\\nBesides some nice findings to potential performance improvements for layer 2\\ntransaction processing, there was not much to announce this time around. Behind\\nthe scenes, however, there have been great progress on the Hydra for Payments\\nproject and the next updates are going to be more interesting again.\\n\\nDespite holiday season approaching, we will march on, steadily adding features\\nand enabling more and more use cases to scale through Hydra.\\n\\n[slides]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TVzjaFKXBi9DAugSd2L8MSUSZGIU9EjTmwf6yccckPI\\n[recording]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_N6b4RDe579TgLawiJzbE0NLofD3ljE6/view"},{"id":"2023-05","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2023-05","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/master/docs/monthly/2023-05-monthly.md","source":"@site/monthly/2023-05-monthly.md","title":"May 2023","description":"This report summarizes the work on Hydra since April 2023.

Until now, this component was only observing\\nprotocol related transactions. Now, on every block roll forward, a `Tick` event\\ncarrying the notion of time from L1 is observed by the `hydra-node` and is used\\nto validate transactions in a Hydra head. This means that clients can submit\\ntime bounded transactions to an open head and expect them to be validated using\\nthe same slot that would be used on L1. It is important to mention that time\\nonly advances on L1 when a block is produced.\\n\\n![Timed transactions in a Hydra Head state channel](./img/2023-05-timed-transactions.jpg) <small><center>Timed transactions in a Hydra Head state channel</center></small>\\n\\nThis feature will make the Hydra L2 ledger now en-par with UTXO features\\navailable on the Cardano L1. A logical next step in this direction could be to\\nmake time in the state channel advance every configured `slotLength` (e.g. every\\nsecond) using the system clock in between blocks as a form of [dead reckoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning).\\n\\n#### Removing --ledger-genesis [#863](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/863)\\n\\nThe hydra-node had two command line options to configure the ledger used for validating layer 2 (L2) transactions: `--ledger-protocol-parameters` and `--ledger-genesis`. The former option, which is self-explanatory, allows configuration of the Cardano protocol parameters to be used. Often, the same parameters as those on L1 are configured, or similar parameters with reduced fees, for example. On the other hand, the second option required the `genesis-shelley.json` file previously used to initialize the Shelley era by the cardano-node.\\n\\nWhen we started using the current slot in the L2 ledger (see above), we realized\\nthat only the start time and slot length are effectively used from that\\nconfiguration file. Moreover, it would be quite surprising if those were\\ndifferent and slots would be longer or shorter on L2 (unless explicitly\\nconfigured). We opted to remove the option altogether and have the `hydra-node`\\nfetch the genesis parameters from the Cardano network. This makes the system\\neasier to configure and more isomorphic to L1.\\n\\n#### Improving CI runtime\\n\\nThe Hydra project [embraces Test Driven Development](./adr/12) and implements\\n[Continuous\\nIntegration](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/actions/workflows/ci-nix.yaml)\\n(CI), checking all these tests pass and more.\\n\\nThe CI could sometimes take as long as an hour or\\nmore to run, which has a negative impact on the project\'s workflow.\\nFor instance, all the project\'s branches have to be [fast-forward with\\nmaster](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/wiki/Coding-Standards#merge-prs-with-merge-commits-and-rebase-branches-on-top-of-master)\\nbefore being merged.\\nSo if all the tests on a branch are green and the pull request has been\\napproved but is lagging a bit behind master, it has to be rebased, so the\\nCI has to run again, incurring a one hour or so delay in this case before\\nbeing able to merge it. The situation becomes worse when several pull requests\\nare _ready_ to be merged.\\n\\nAnalyzing the run from [May, 10th](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/actions/runs/4933005294)\\nwe can see that:\\n\\n- Building and testing takes 19 minutes for the longest\\n- Generating haddock documentation and running the benchmarks takes 28 minutes\\n  for the longest\\n- Documentation (which will need artifacts generated in previous steps) will take\\n  14 minutes\\n- In total, this run took 1 hour and 16 minutes.\\n\\nLet\'s focus on the build and the testing stage first. We\'re expecting the\\nplutus-merkle-tree to run fast but [it took 8 minutes and 52\\nseconds](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/actions/runs/4933005294/jobs/8816564512)\\n, 7m and 11 seconds being spent setting up the build environment.\\nIn other words, 81% of the build time is downloading binary dependencies from some nix cache.\\n\\nCompiling the code requires cabal and other nix dependencies that will trigger\\nmassive downloads. Instead, let\'s, straight on, run the tests with nix and let\\nnix decide what needs to be compiled. Sometimes, most of the code will not have\\nchanged and the test binary will already be available in some nix cache to be run\\nwithout any compilation step.\\n\\nThis has been done in [#867](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/867).\\nMerging this PR, the [build on master took 45\\nminutes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/actions/runs/5003046049) and,\\nspecifically, the same [plutus-merkle-tree\\njob](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/actions/runs/5003046049/jobs/8963773583)\\nonly took 1 minute and 44 seconds, only 20% of the time observed before.\\n\\nThen, let\'s focus on documentation (14 minutes). Most of the time spent by this\\nprocess is website optimization. It makes sense for the documentation that will\\nactually be published on the website (master or release). But what about all\\nthe builds in branches for which the website will never be published?\\nWe need to keep this documentation step in branches because it gives us sanity\\nchecks, preventing broken links, for instance. But we can definitely remove the\\noptimization step.\\n\\nThis has been done in [#880](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/880)\\nand it [saves 10 minutes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/actions/runs/5067084637/jobs/9098252031)\\nfrom this step.\\n\\nOur first goal was to reduce CI execution time when pushing\\non branches and this has been improved. We\'re now having execution time\\nsignificantly under 30 minutes where it used to be 45 minutes or even an hour.\\n\\nWe had some issues with compilation output, obfuscated by nix, which have been\\nsolved by [#889](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/889).\\n\\nEvery morning, we rebuild our master branch and we can observe the whole\\nexecution time on the following graph (in seconds):\\n\\n![CI perf](./img/2023-05-ci-perf.png) <small><center>C.I. execution total execution time</center></small>\\n\\nAlthough we observed performance improvements on branches CI execution time,\\nmaster execution time has not been reduced that much. We may save 10 minutes\\nfrom the documentation step because optimizing the _unstable_ documentation is\\nmaybe not worthwhile.\\nBut what\'s more problematic here is the process variability.\\n\\nThis variability can be explained by nix cache misses. That\'s something we need\\nto investigate. It\'s hard to optimize a process with buffers, especially here\\nwhere in case of a cache miss, recompilation has to happen and takes time.\\nSo every cache miss introduces several minutes of overhead which explains why we\\nobserve so much variation between two days with this master execution time.\\n\\nNext steps:\\n\\n- Inspect why we have an unexpected random cache miss\\n- Improve haddock generation time (15 minutes)\\n- Reduce bench time (we probably don\'t want to run the whole benchmark suite for\\n  every single commit, or a smaller one)\\n- Focus on the changed area (do not compile everything to generate the monthly\\n  report)\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n#### Hydrozoa [#850](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/850)\\n\\nThis month, the project saw a new kind of contribution from the community.\\n@GeorgeFlerovsky has written a research piece about an adaptation of the\\n(Coordinated) Hydra Head protocol into a new flavor - Hydrozoa. The article is\\ncurrently being examined and [discussed on\\nGitHub](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/850). Feedback so\\nfar has been positive. Of course, one does not simply change the Hydra Head\\nprotocol (pun intended), but the ideas contained could drive evolution and\\nbe followed up with concrete protocol extensions. Very much like the ideas\\npresented in the original paper.\\n\\n#### Hydra for Payments project update\\n\\nIn this collaborative effort between IOG and ObsidianSystems, we are pushing the\\nfrontiers of using Hydra in payment use cases. It will lower the entry barrier\\nfor developers and ultimately users to leverage Hydra L2 for sending\\nand receiving ada and Cardano native assets with very low fees and sub-second\\nfinality.\\n\\nThe project is in its second phase where the open-source\\n[hydra-pay](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/hydra-pay) library is being\\nexpanded with necessary features while the team pushes for building a\\ndedicated mobile application.\\n\\nWith the recently released hydra-pay version\\n[0.2.0](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/hydra-pay/releases/tag/v0.2.0), an\\nend-to-end workflow of the Android App nicknamed \\"HydraNow\\" can be realized.\\nThis app will act as a layer 2 wallet quite like a Bitcoin Lightning Wallet and\\ndrives feature development in both `hydra-pay` and `hydra` in the background.\\n\\n![Two instances of HydraNow (in browser) connected via a hydra-pay channel](./img/2023-05-hydra-now.png) <small><center>Two instances of HydraNow (in browser) connected via a hydra-pay channel</center></small>\\n\\n#### Spanish translation\\n\\nLast, but not least, we would like to thank @Agustinblockchain for their\\ncontribution of a [Spanish translation #866](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/866)\\nof the [hydra.family website](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/unstable/es/) \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe monthly review meeting for May was held on 2023-05-24 via Google Meet with\\nthese [slides][slides] and here is the [recording][recording].\\n\\nThe monthly review meeting was lively and we had stakeholders from IOG as well\\nas interested community members join. They were well served by two very nice\\ndemos shown by ObsidianSystems and IOG teams.\\n\\nAfter having dealt with some issues last month, we are happy to have\\nthe first mainnet-capable version released and have already another feature\\ncompleted this month.\\n\\nIt is great to see that more and more contributors from the community are\\nstepping up to become advocates of the technology. A community is forming and we\\nrealize that the project could need some help from someone dedicated to keep\\ntrack of all the great things happening. What a great problem to have!\\n\\n[slides]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1anUC3Z1idloyR6uwiSHLZtV6-LQvUcByHPMUgCBOVIA\\n[recording]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_N6b4RDe579TgLawiJzbE0NLofD3ljE6/view"},{"id":"2023-04","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2023-04","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/master/docs/monthly/2023-04-monthly.md","source":"@site/monthly/2023-04-monthly.md","title":"April 2023","description":"This report summarizes the work on Hydra since March 2023.

The process involves clarifying and\\n  refining each idea item into a \ud83d\udcac **feature** before starting work on it. This\\n  includes giving equal consideration to new user \ud83d\udcad **idea**s and requests.\\n\\n- Temporarily postponed the [Hydra heads explorer\\n  #696](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/696) item until there is\\n  more clarity. While there aren\'t any major blockers,the explorer just requires\\n  further detailing, especially since we\'re currently in talks with existing\\n  Cardano explorer platforms.\\n\\n- Converted the [aggregated multi-signature\\n  #193](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/193) from the concrete\\n  roadmap into an [idea discussion\\n  #787](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/787). This is based\\n  on feedback from the community, and we believe that discussing it there would\\n  be more beneficial.\\n\\n- The main focus for the 0.10.0 release is implementing mainnet compatibility.\\n  This is mostly done and only requires some documentation and disclaimer\\n  updates. We\'re about to release 0.10.0, which will be the first\\n  mainnet-compatible version.\\n\\n- Meanwhile, work on the [configurable API\\n  #380](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/380) was completed,\\n  which gave rise to new ideas and follow-up feature requests from users. One of\\n  them ([Add HeadState/Snapshot to Greetings\\n  #823](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/823)) was fairly\\n  straightforward and necessary to deliver a consistent, usable increment on the\\n  API with the upcoming release.\\n\\n- Prioritized [Support timed transactions\\n  #196](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/196) higher as yet\\n  another use case would benefit from this.\\n\\n![](./img/2023-04-roadmap-ex-ideas.png) <small><center>The roadmap without idea items</center></small>\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n[Issues and pull requests closed since last\\nreport](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2023-03-29..2023-04-26)\\n\\nThis month, the team worked on the following:\\n\\n#### Configurable API\\n\\nThe API evolved a bit, driven by the issues our users reported\\n[#823](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/823)\\n[#813](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/813)\\n[#800](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/800)\\n[#789](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/789). Related changes\\nwere added to the API server so now our clients can:\\n\\n- Control the historical messages output. History messages can be displayed\\n  upon re/connection or not depending on client needs.\\n- Snapshot UTXOs can optionally be disabled.\\n- Transactions can be displayed in CBOR or JSON format.\\n\\nOur clients can also have a nice insight into the current Hydra node state and head UTXOs\\nthat are now displayed as part of a `Greetings` message.\\n\\nNext steps on the API level are to further fulfill user needs by grooming and\\nimplementing needed changes related to filtering, pagination etc.\\n\\n#### Versioned docs and specification\\n\\nOver the [last couple of months](/monthly/2023-02#development) the Hydra\\nspecification became an important artifact to use in discussion, review and\\npotential audit of the Hydra Head protocol implementation. The document was now\\nmoved from overleaf into the Hydra repository, where it is properly versioned\\nand built on each CI run. Changes can be proposed using our regular pull request\\nworfklow and the final PDF is built and [published to the\\nwebsite](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/unstable/core-concepts/specification)\\nautomatically.\\n\\nNote that the above link points to the new `/unstable` version of the\\ndocumentation, which holds the bleeding edge user manual, specification and\\nAPI reference (which got a new sidebar) built directly from `master`. The\\nnormal, non-unstable version of the website is always referring to the [last\\nreleased version](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/releases).\\n\\n![](./img/2023-04-specification.png) <small><center>Specification on the Hydra website</center></small>\\n\\n#### Fixed scripts, Plutonomy and custom script contexts\\n\\nAs we made the specification use a more direct way to represent transactions\\n(instead of the constraint emitting machine formalism), we realized that our\\nscripts are not correctly ensuring _script continuity_. We identified these\\n\'gaps\' as red sections (see above) in the specification and worked on fixing\\nthem.\\n\\nWhile the [actual fix #777](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/777)\\nwas fairly straightforward and could easily be covered by our mutation-based\\ncontract tests, the script size increased and we could not publish all three\\nHydra scripts in a single publish transaction (which allows for a single\\n`--hydra-scripts-tx-id` parameter on the `hydra-node`).\\n\\nTo mitigate this, we looked into the UPLC optimizer\\n[Plutonomy](https://github.com/well-typed/plutonomy/tree/master/src/Plutonomy).\\nApplying it was fairly simple, our tests did also pass, script sizes _and\\ncosts_ also became lower. But, script size does not matter so much as we are\\nusing reference scripts and using a (not really maintained?) optimizer which\\nintroduces yet another question mark after compilation from `plutus-tx` to\\n`uplc` was not our cup of tea right now at least (and we might pull this out\\nof the drawer later).\\n\\nThere is an alternative: decoding `ScriptContext` involves quite some code,\\nbut we don\'t need everything in all validators. So we introduced a\\ncustomscript context that only decodes the fields we need.\\n\\n| scripts  | @0.9.0 | fixes | fixes + plutonomy | fixes + custom ScriptContext |\\n| -------- | ------ | ----- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |\\n| \u03bdInitial | 4621   | 4727  | 3672              | 4300                         |\\n| \u03bdCommit  | 2422   | 2513  | 1816              | 2068                         |\\n| \u03bdHead    | 8954   | 9492  | 7579              | 9456 (no custom SC)          |\\n| \u03bcHead    | 4458   | 4537  | 3468              | 4104                         |\\n\\nAs part of this process, we also updated dependencies #[826](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/826) to the latest\\n`cardano-node` master. Although it didn\'t have an impact on script sizes, it\'s a\\ncrucial step towards preparing for upcoming hard-forks.\\n\\n#### Rollback bug hunt\\n\\nOpening our first head on mainnet failed. We didn\'t\\nlose any funds, except for some fees, but the head just did not open.\\nExploring the logs, we figured out that a rollback happened while opening the\\nhead and there was a bug.\\n\\nThis is our test pyramid. It already contained some tests about the rollback but\\nwe decided to enrich our model-based tests to simulate rollbacks (before that,\\nit used to run on a _perfect_ blockchain). You can find more about our\\nmodel-based test strategy in [Model-Based Testing with\\nQuickCheck](https://engineering.iog.io/2022-09-28-introduce-q-d/).\\n\\n![test pyramid](./img/2023-04-test-pyramide.png) <small><center>Testing pyramide</center></small>\\n\\nThe new property\\n[headOpensIfAllPartiesCommit](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/commit_vs_rollback/hydra-node/test/Hydra/ModelSpec.hs#L185)\\nhelped prove the issue. At the end of the day, the problem came from a\\nconcurrency issue introduced while implementing [ADR 18](./adr/18).\\n\\nIn the figure below, the `DirectChain` processes a new block, updating the\\n`chainState` stored inside the `headState`. This also leads to an event being\\npublished to some event queue. Later, the `HeadLogic` (called _Node_ in the\\npicture) will process this event, updating the `headState`.\\n\\nAt the end of the process, we can see that the new `headState` points to a\\n`previousRecoverableState` which contains the same `chainState`, `chainState 1`\\ninstead of `chainState 0`. If a rollback then happens, the `headState` will be\\nreverted to this `previousRecoverableState` and the fact that it contains\\n`chainState 1` instead of `chainState 0` makes some on-chain observations\\nimpossible.\\n\\n![Race condition](./img/2023-04-race-condition.png) <small><center>Race condition</center></small>\\n\\nThis explains the issue we had when opening our head:\\n\\n1. a commit A is observed on-chain;\\n2. a rollback happens so that the headState _forgets_ about this commit but not\\n   the `chainState` (remember, it\'s the wrong `chainState`);\\n3. the commit is observed again on the chain but ignored by the `chainState` (because\\n   it has already seen it, it just ignores it);\\n4. the `headState` will never hear about this commit again and so will never open\\n   the head, waiting forever for the missing commit.\\n\\nWe decided to implement the following solution:\\n\\n- A local chain state is re-introduced in the chain component, not shared with\\n  the head logic.\\n- A copy of the chain state is kept in the head state to keep the benefits of\\n  ADR [18](./adr/18) regarding persistence.\\n- The rollback event is removed from the API until [#185](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/185).\\n\\n![possible solution](./img/2023-04-possible-solution.png) <small><center>Possible solution</center></small>\\n\\nRollback management is quite a tricky business. It might be the case that we\'ve\\ntried to be a bit too smart. So we\'re doing a rollback in our way of handling\\nrollbacks until we focus on this topic again when dealing with this roadmap item:\\n[Handle rollbacks II](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/185).\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n#### Hydra for Voting\\n\\nThe project is advancing and a basic vote tallying scenario in the Catalyst use\\ncase was demonstrated in the review meeting. The project is driving the API\\ndiscussions as it is not using any Haskell tooling, but an application in Java\\nwith Aiken as the validator scripting language. Besides the catalyst use case,\\nother scenarios like the ballot voting for the summit are also explored now.\\n\\n#### Hydra for Auctions\\n\\nA new demo was recorded in the wake of an upcoming Twitter space discussing\\nauctions and NFT marketplaces with the community. The feature set currently\\nincludes starting the auction on L1, bidding on L1 or (and this is the novel\\nthing!) transferring the auction from L1 to L2, such that it can be bid on L2.\\n\\n<div style={{position: \\"relative\\", paddingBottom: \\"56.25%\\", height: 0}}>\\n  <iframe src=\\"https://www.loom.com/embed/7ed84e37d65748d994d8a0be147f7ecb\\"\\n  frameborder=\\"0\\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen\\n  style={{position: \\"absolute\\", top: 0, left: 0, width: \\"100%\\", height:\\n  \\"100%\\"}}></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n#### Kupo x Hydra\\n\\nIn a good old pairing session between IOG and CF engineers, the integration of\\nKupo with Hydra was explored. This seems to be promising and work started [here\\nkupo#117](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/pull/117). This will make it\\npossible to run `kupo` natively connected to a `hydra-node`, very much it would\\nrun with `cardano-node` or `ogmios`. Kupo is a lightweight indexer of chain data\\nlike unspent transaction outputs and allows its clients to query information\\non-demand. \ud83d\udc39\\n\\n#### CBIA meetings\\n\\nHydra Team is now a regular participant to [Cardano Blockchain Infrastructure\\nAlliance](https://www.cbia.io/) meetings which happen more or less on a monthly\\nbasis. Hydra was featured during the meetup that happened while the team was on\\na [workshop in Feldkirch](/monthly/2023-03) and through this participation we\\nhope to contribute to growth of the Cardano eco-system and position Hydra as a\\nkey infrastructure for builders.\\n\\n#### Twitter space on scaling Cardano\\n\\nThis month we took part in a Twitter space about scaling Cardano and how Hydra\\ncan contribute to this. Thanks for conducting this\\n[@thepizzaknight\\\\_](https://twitter.com/thepizzaknight_) \ud83d\ude4f\\n\\n<a href=\\"https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1vOxwMVDaXLGB\\">\\n\\n![](./img/2023-04-twitter-space.png)\\n\\n</a>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe monthly review meeting for April was held on 2023-04-26 via Google Meet with\\nthese\\n[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10wZJy0tyGMbvMihbHnHk0QByA_TAZrtbcRbf5Gd-SHg/)\\nand here is the\\n[recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X4yPerLTatPPMrX3RYS7XH9lfT_LYaaX/view?usp=sharing).\\n\\nAlthough it has been a busy month we could not cut a release, unfortunately.\\n\\nWe\'ve experienced several setbacks due to the commits vs. rollbacks bug and oversized script sizes, which have slowed down our progress. Additionally, the back and forth on the API, which at times required creative and unconventional solutions, has also been time-intensive. However, we view this feedback as **incredibly** valuable, as it will ultimately make hydra-node more user-friendly and capable, albeit through a step-by-step process.\\n\\nAssociated projects in the greater Hydra community are moving ahead nicely\\ndue to the collaborative approach and tight loops of interaction between the\\nindividual teams.\\n\\nAll things considered, the project can be considered on track. We are very close to cutting our first mainnet-compatible release and the rising number of user\\nrequests and interested developers are good indicators that Hydra adoption\\nis increasing."},{"id":"2023-03","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2023-03","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/master/docs/monthly/2023-03-monthly.md","source":"@site/monthly/2023-03-monthly.md","title":"March 2023","description":"This report summarizes the work on Hydra since February 2023.

The\\n  next planned version **0.10.0** will be the first `hydra-node` to be\\n  mainnet compatible.\\n\\n- Also prioritized [API configurability\\n  #380](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/380) higher and planned\\n  it into 0.10.0 as more users were requesting this.\\n\\n- We aim for several more **0.x.0** versions to incorporate user-requested\\n  features before reaching a 1.0.0, which will be a fully maintained release\\n  where features can be considered stable and won\'t be removed without\\n  appropriate deprecation cycles.\\n\\n- Marked multiple features as \ud83d\udcad _idea_, meaning they are up for discussion.\\n  Many have been on the roadmap for a long time without user demand or input,\\n  while other ideas are incubating as [github idea\\n  discussion](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/categories/ideas).\\n  We are planning to convert these idea issues to GitHub discussions as these\\n  provide better dicussion tools and allow to gauge interest in topics. In turn,\\n  by cleaning up we provide more room for the most popular ideas to be planned\\n  onto the roadmap in a more timely manner.\\n\\n- In short, if you want to see some feature added, **show your support** on the\\n  corresponding [idea\\n  discussion](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/categories/ideas).\\n\\n- The \ud83d\udcac _feature_ items remaining are the currently identifed \\"must-haves\\" or\\n  too vague to remove \ud83d\udd34 _red_ items.\\n\\n![](./img/2023-03-roadmap-ex-ideas.png) <small><center>The roadmap without idea items.</center></small>\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n[Issues and pull requests closed since last\\nreport](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2023-02-24..2023-03-29)\\n\\nThis month, the team worked on the following:\\n\\n- **Making Hydra mainnet compatible.** Besides making it technically possible to\\n  run on mainnet, this is about safeguarding our users and preventing them from\\n  shooting themselves in the foot with a mainnet gun. That is why we\\n  [limited](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/762) the amount of\\n  ada you can commit to a head on mainnet. Our smoke tests should be running on\\n  mainnet also so we made sure to\\n  [return](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/770) the leftover funds\\n  back to our faucet. There was also\\n  [work](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/775) on our CI that\\n  enables running the tests on mainnet using a dedicated github runner.\\n\\n- **Improving the Hydra UX.** We noticed a possible pitfall when restarting the\\n  `hydra-node` using different parameters than in the persisted state. Now, the\\n  node would [prevent](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/764) this\\n  kind of misconfiguration.\\n\\n- **Optimize the on-chain scripts.** Reduced the cost of opening/closing a Head\\n  by reducing size of scripts via error codes\\n  [#748](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/748) and also having the\\n  head script as a reference only\\n  [#701](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/701)).\\n\\n  The mutation test also got improved by making all cases expect the\\n  corresponding error codes\\n  [#705](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/705) and new [golden\\n  test suite ](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/772) ensures the\\n  script hashes don\'t change accidentally.\\n\\n  Furthermore, we addressed a problem discovered in our property tests\\n  [#724](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/724) by preventing\\n  committing outputs with reference scripts to a Head\\n  [#766](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/766). This is still a\\n  documented known issue, but a workaround is available.\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n- **Team workshop in Austria.** Meetup of core contributors in Feldkirch,\\n  Austria for retrospective, grooming and discussions on future plans for\\n  Hydra. Part of the agenda was also a presentation of Hydra to members of the\\n  Cardano Foundation and a meeting with builders from the Cardano community.\\n\\n  The highlight, though was the common effort of going the last mile to open a\\n  head on mainnet for the monthly review meeting! \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n    <blockquote class=\\"twitter-tweet\\"><p lang=\\"en\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">JUST IN: We have a Hydra Head live on the <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cardano?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\">#Cardano</a> Mainnet \ud83d\ude80 <a href=\\"https://t.co/6kDKq7T7no\\">pic.twitter.com/6kDKq7T7no</a></p>&mdash; Emmanuel \ud80c\udc80 \ud83c\udf55 \ud80c\udd53\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udded\ud83e\udd84\ud83d\udfe3\u26a1\ufe0f (@thepizzaknight_) <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/thepizzaknight_/status/1638572527789252608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\">March 22, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\" charset=\\"utf-8\\"><\/script>\\n\\n  We demonstrated our good old `hydraw` application on that Hydra head and we\\n  saw thousands of pixels painted by hundreds of users (no detailed metrics).\\n\\n- **Next step in Hydra for Payments.** Also announced in the monthly meeting was\\n  the next phase on the Hydra for Payments project.

The demo was well received and we\\nreceived positive feedback in the meeting, on following twitter announcements\\nand on the published recording on youtube. Inspired by this, we saw multiple\\npeople offer to help and collaborate on communicating, educating and ultimately\\nspreading the love. The invitation via the new discord category worked well - we\\nhad about 40 community members in the call - and we will continue with this\\nworkflow. Make sure to follow the Hydra\\n[#announcements](https://discord.gg/Bwdy2jNdm2) on the IOG Technical discord\\nserver.\\n\\nWhile being mainnet compatible is a major milestone for the project, there are\\nstill many known issues, shortcomings and requested features. The roadmap\\nchanges this month should make it clear that we are serious about the latter -\\nHydra will only reach 1.0.0 if it is used by an application on mainnet. Hence,\\nwe will focus on adding features required for payments, voting, auctions, ...\\nand eventually, your use case.\\n\\nHydra Head is ready to be used on mainnet.

It serves as\\npreparation for the monthly review meeting, where the teams update major project\\nstakeholders on recent developments to gather their feedback on proposed plans.\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\nLooking at the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21),\\nthere are a few things that changed this month:\\n\\n- In general, there will be several items in flux as we align the technical\\n  roadmap to support our high-level objectives for the year.\\n\\n  + New items for example: [create a use case-centric roadmap\\n  #710](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/710) and [open\\n  specification with change process\\n  #693](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/693).\\n\\n- Also note that we have not had a release in a while and we want to have\\n  smaller faster releasable items again.\\n\\n- [Aligning implementation with HeadV1 specification\\n  #452](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/452) was more work than\\n  anticipated. There was quite some back and forth with the writing of the\\n  specification and discussions with researchers leading to scope creep.  \\n  Most importantly, we made on-chain behavior consistent with specification.\\n  + Follow-ups for some off-chain protocol logic:\\n    - [Authenticate network messages\\n      #727](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/727)\\n    - [ReqSn only sends transaction ids\\n      #728](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/728)\\n  \\n- Version **0.9.0** will be the first release to be developed against a full\\n  technical specification. We expect a release in early March.\\n\\n- Version **0.10.0** will be the first mainnet compatible release. For this, we\\n  created and groomed the main feature item [Mainnnet compatibility\\n  #713](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/713):\\n  - Not only making it technically compatible but also adding guard rails to\\n    limit risk (\u201cnot shoot yourself in the foot .. with a real gun now\u201d) and\\n    documenting known issues.\\n\\n- For a fully maintained version **1.0.0** we still need to address some things,\\n  but we aim for an increased rate of planned releases in the next months as we\\n  march toward it.\\n  \\n![](./img/2023-02-roadmap.png) <small><center> The latest roadmap with multiple\\nnew items and starting to reflect Hydra objectives of 2023.</center></small>\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n[Issues and pull requests closed since last\\nreport](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2023-01-24..2023-02-28)\\n\\nThis month, the team worked on the following:\\n  \\n- **Aligning specification and implementation**. This major [feature\\n  item](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/452) was the topic we\\n  worked on over the last couple of months. This time we could finish the major,\\n  must-have parts and can continue now on other features. Notable things from\\n  this month were:\\n  \\n  **Pushing out contestation deadlines:** The original paper defined that all\\n  participants need to be contesting within the contestation period (after\\n  close, before the deadline). In discussions with researchers last year, we\\n  identified better semantics: the contestation deadline gets \\"pushed out\\" on\\n  each contest. This has the benefit that the period needs to only accommodate\\n  the minimum time required to get a single contest transaction into the\\n  blockchain. Before it was depending on the size of the Hydra head - each\\n  participant can contest once.\\n  \\n  **Align off-chain protocol logic:** While most concerns addressed were about\\n  the on-chain scripts of the Hydra protocol, this is about the layer two\\n  protocol logic. That is, which messages are exchanged between Hydra nodes and\\n  how a node reacts to them. Here we realized that the implementation was\\n  slightly different from the formalism used in the paper and specification.\\n  This makes it non-obvious whether the behavior is exactly as specified or\\n  whether the specification can even be implemented into a working system.\\n  \\n  To clarify this, we put in some effort to align the implementation with the\\n  specification and the other way around. This allowed us to reason through our\\n  behavior tests whether the protocol as specified is sound as well. Below you\\n  see an excerpt of the Haskell code against the LaTeX pseudocode formalism:\\n  \\n  <center> <img src={require(\\"./img/2023-02-logic-haskell.png\\").default}\\n    style={{width: 310}} /> <img\\n    src={require(\\"./img/2023-02-logic-latex.png\\").default} style={{width: 250}}\\n    /> </center>\\n \\n- **Profiling Hydra transactions.** We will want to maximize the capability of\\n  the Hydra Head protocol. This includes writing the on-chain scripts\\n  efficiently. Besides having [transaction cost\\n  benchmarks](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/benchmarks/transaction-cost/),\\n  we worked on a profiling workflow for Hydra protocol transactions and\\n  published a [tutorial on the Hydra\\n  website](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/benchmarks/profiling). This allows\\n  any contributor to [Hydra](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra) to\\n  profile the scripts used in these transactions and identify code that uses a\\n  lot of the memory or CPU budget in flame graphs like this:\\n  \\n  ![](../benchmarks/profile-mem.svg) [Interactive]Head not closable/limiting\\n  script size discussion + acceptance property\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n- **Audit guidelines.** Hydra is an open-source project and, as such, should be\\n  freely used, reviewed and audited. The goal of audits and peer reviews is to\\n  increase confidence in the security of a system. However, conducting an audit\\n  is also very expensive and not in the scope of our current budget. All the\\n  while, the worth of an audit is not the same to all users, some will not even\\n  trust an audit they have not paid for themselves, while others do not care at\\n  all and would blindly trust the word of the maintainers.\\n  \\n  While the Hydra project continues to seek for funding to eventually pay for an\\n  audit of the protocol specification and the `hydra-node` implementation, it is\\n  a prerequisite that the necessary artifacts for such an audit exist. As we\\n  have been creating them in recent months, we also worked on guidelines for\\n  auditors, now [published on our\\n  website](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/audit-guidelines/). These\\n  guidelines should serve as a starting point and scope description of what\\n  would be most crucial to audit.\\n\\n- **New tutorial.** This month we received a great contribution from\\n  [@perturbing](https://github.com/perturbing/), who created an [end-to-end\\n  tutorial](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/tutorial/) on using a\\n  `hydra-node` and opening a Hydra head on the testnet. We gladly adopted this\\n  tutorial and aim to keep it up to date with upcoming versions of the\\n  `hydra-node`. It will provide a great starting point for new users and makes\\n  the project more approachable. Thanks! :green_heart:\\n\\n- **Hydra for Payments demo.** As we are about to kick off the next phase of the\\n  payments use case with Obsidian Systems, they demonstrated the use of\\n  [hydra-pay](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/hydra-pay) in a new\\n  backoffice-like view, listing multiple payment channels and providing a great\\n  teaser of using payment channels for pay-per-use APIs or cashback use cases\\n  (micro-transactions).\\n\\n  ![](./img/2023-02-payment-channels.png)\\n\\n- **Hydra for Voting.** The project with Catalyst and Cardano Foundation on\\n  voting with Hydra (or rather *tallying* with Hydra) showed some progress. They\\n  have [contributed Merkle Trees to\\n  Aiken](https://github.com/aiken-lang/trees/pull/1), which will be useful to\\n  prove the correct tallying of votes in the L2. They started work on a\\n  [hydra-java-client](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/hydra-java-client)\\n  and provided valuable feedback on the `hydra-node` API over the last month.\\n\\n- **Hydra on Demeter.** The folks from [@txpipe](https://github.com/txpipe) have\\n  been working on integrating Hydra into their platform-as-a-service offering,\\n  Demeter. This is a great way to get started with running a `hydra-node` as a\\n  service and we plan on integrating one instance into our long-running hydraw\\n  demo. It\'s still not fully released, but the teams are working together to\\n  make this integration great. Thanks for providing this service! :green_heart:\\n  \\n- **New discord category.** The Hydra project will be using Discord a bit more\\n  in the coming weeks and months. For that, a new category on the [IOG Technical\\n  Discord server](https://discord.gg/Bwdy2jNdm2) has been created. Look out for\\n  news and, most importantly, invites for the next month\'s review meeting in the\\n  new Hydra #announcements channel!\\n  \\n  <div style={{display: \'flex\'}}> <img\\n    src={require(\\"./img/2023-02-discord.png\\").default} style={{width: 300,\\n    margin: \'0 auto\'}} /> </div>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe monthly review meeting for February was conducted on 2023-02-27 via Google\\nMeet -\\n[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FjLvlLS4Qh6dwuULFJxielvemDGi-xiWZ2o6wysJk7U/edit#slide=id.g1f87a7454a5_0_1392)\\n/\\n[recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15l5F5NJNO1aC4X8HdQUDsg_dKMgVCO-J/view?usp=sharing).\\n\\nThis month\'s installment featured two demos, one about the Hydra Payment\\nchannels, and another about the progress on the Hydra for Auctions project. It\\nwas great to showcase not only core development progress on the specification\\nand protocol implementation in the `hydra-node`, but also to see contributions\\nfrom the Community on tutorials and tooling (Demeter integration).\\n\\nAn exciting, but also challenging next step will be to aim for mainnet\\ncompatibility and at the same time deliver quick releases to enable these\\nlighthouse projects and the increasing number of use cases explored by the\\nbuilders of Cardano."},{"id":"2023-01","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2023-01","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/master/docs/monthly/2023-01-monthly.md","source":"@site/monthly/2023-01-monthly.md","title":"January 2023","description":"This report summarizes the work on Hydra since December 2022.

The team has been aggregating the\\n  latest definitions of on- and off-chain semantics into a new technical\\n  specification. The latest version can still be found [on\\n  Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6389ba5edbcf7a51fda1328f), before\\n  its integration into the core Hydra repository. Should you have feedback,\\n  please send it our way through one of the [communication\\n  channels](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/SUPPORT.md).\\n\\n- **Closed more gaps in the Head Contract.** The team addressed two more gaps in\\n  the on-chain scripts based on discussions on the specification.\\n\\n  + All validators are authenticated now and ensure contract continuity by\\n    checking for the state tokens in the output (or getting burned).\\n\\n  + Abort now fully reimburses all committed UTXOs, even if two parties would\\n    have committed the exact same output (quite a theoretical attack vector).\\n\\n  This work is captured in\\n  [#452](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/452), but this work\\n  item is taking quite a bit longer than expected. Also, it\'s a single feature\\n  item, lacking some rationale on certain requirements, so we intend to break\\n  this down into smaller pieces over the next days and weeks.\\n\\n- **Mutation test framework improvements.** While closing gaps in the contracts,\\n  the team realized that some of the [mutation\\n  tests](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/haddock/hydra-node/tests/Hydra-Chain-Direct-Contract-Mutation.html)\\n  were correctly tripping validators and making transactions invalid, but not\\n  always for the right reason. In fact, some of the mutations were \u2018too harsh\u2019\\n  and made the even transaction not even pass phase-1 validation. The team\\n  addressed this by introducing a first (naiive) way to assert the right cause\\n  of the failure by checking strings in the validator log.\\n  [#679](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pulls/679)\\n\\n- **Add `headId` in API and TUI.** The team not only added the unique `headId`\\n  to the appropriate server outputs and the TUI\\n  [#678](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/678), but also added\\n  sequence numbers and timestamps to produced outputs\\n  [#618](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/618). This feature was\\n  asked for by users and simplifies identifying of heads and integration with\\n  the hydra-node.\\n\\n- **Hydra explorer experiment.** Some of the team used the holiday season to\\n  conduct some experiments on summarizing Hydra Heads observed on a network.\\n  This quick hack already demonstrates the value of a Hydra explorer as a tool\\n  to measure adoption by open heads on a given network. Naturally, it would\\n  reuse code from the hydra-node and challenge the architecture used in it for\\n  tracking multiple heads. Also, it will drive discussion about the versioning\\n  of hydra-plutus and the possibility to track multiple versions of the Hydra\\n  protocol on the chain (hashes/addresses change in each version).\\n  \\n![](./img/2023-01-explorer.png) <small><center> Hydra explorer first experiment\\nUI </center></small>\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n- **The Hydra for Voting project**, which got kicked off in December is picking\\n  up steam with deep dives into Catalyst voting and Hydra technology.\\n  Discussions are currently held in various settings and the team is continuing\\n  to develop a picture of what is achievable.\\n\\n- **Hydra for auctions lite paper**. IOG is collaborating with MLabs on\\n  exploring how Hydra can improve auction use cases. At this stage, the teams\\n  discussed multiple approaches on structuring the problem space with various\\n  Hydra topologies and specific trade-offs. The full case study was published\\n  [on Essential\\n  Cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/implementing-auction-projects-using-hydra).\\n  The teams plan to upstream the findings back into the [use case\\n  section](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/use-cases/nft-auction/) on the\\n  Hydra website from which this project originated.\\n  \\n## Themes for 2023\\n\\nAfter kicking off planning in a\\n[workshop](http://ncoding.at:3000/head-protocol/monthly/2022-11#cardano-summit--workshop)\\nand reflecting on [what Hydra achieved in\\n2023](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/hydra-head-protocol-an-open-source-solution-for-scalability/),\\nthe team has progressed in fleshing out relevant themes and objectives for this\\nyear to position Hydra as a sustainable open-source project in the age of\\nVoltaire:\\n\\n- **A mainnet mature application**\\n  + **Why?** The core contributors should be able to use the protocol on\\n    mainnet, so it should be maintainable and mature enough to lock some ada in\\n    a Hydra Head using a reference DApp (eg, hydraw).

This was the first\\nstep to a more open and transparent development process.\\n\\nThe teams showed some classic demos \u2013 like the \u2018hydraw\u2019 application which has\\nbeen running on the same Hydra Head for four weeks now \u2013 and some new\\ndevelopments on the Hydra explorer and minor improvements to hydra-node API and\\nTUI.\\n\\nIt was very interesting to bring various teams together to exchange ideas and\\nthoughts on the individual roadmaps for the new year. The teams also shared the\\nrelevant themes and objectives of the Hydra project for 2023 (as also listed\\nabove). They will now make sure to reflect these steps into this concrete\\n[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21) such that it will\\ncontain [marketable features](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mmf/)\\nbringing us closer to these goals."},{"id":"2022-12","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2022-12","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/master/docs/monthly/2022-12-monthly.md","source":"@site/monthly/2022-12-monthly.md","title":"December 2022","description":"This report summarizes the work on Hydra since November 2022 and also serves as","date":"2023-01-09T08:43:30.000Z","formattedDate":"9 janvier 2023","tags":[{"label":"monthly","permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/tags/monthly"}],"readingTime":4,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Nagel","title":"Software Engineering Lead - Hydra @ IOG","url":"https://github.com/ch1bo","imageURL":"https://github.com/ch1bo.png","key":"ch1bo"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"December 2022","slug":"2022-12","authors":"ch1bo","tags":["monthly"]},"prevItem":{"title":"January 2023","permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2023-01"},"nextItem":{"title":"November 2022","permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2022-11"}},"content":"This report summarizes the work on Hydra since November 2022 and also serves as\\na preparation & write-up of the monthly review meeting, in which we update major\\nstakeholders of the project on recent developments and gather their feedback on\\nour proposed plan forward each month.\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\nLooking at our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21) we\\ncan report the following updates:\\n\\n#### Notable changes\\n\\n- Completed [Validate coordinated head protocol against formal model #194 ](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/194) \\n- Detailed a follow-up [Validate soundness with Model Based Testing #656](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/656)\\n- Focus on specification and gap-closing to support audit\\n- Scoped down 0.9.0 to be only about script updates and moved [Commit from external wallet #215](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/215) into next version\\n- Groomed [React to mainchain protocol changes #195](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/195)\\n- More users requesting [Support timed transactions #196](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/196)\\n  \\n![](./img/2022-12-roadmap.png)\\n<small><center>\\nLatest roadmap with drafted 0.10.0 version.\\n</center></small>\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n[Issues closed since last report](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A2022-11-30..2022-12-31)\\n\\nThis month we have been working on:\\n\\n- **Fixed `AcquirePointTooOld` errors** by changing the way the internal wallet\\n  initializes its state\\n  [#621](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/621). See the PR\\n  description for details. This did not strictly happen this month, but we have\\n  not mentioned it last time. \\n\\n- **Closed first gap in Head Contract**: We collected gaps between specification\\n  and current implementation in\\n  [#452](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/452) and started now\\n  closing them. This first issue, was to prevent DoS / stalling of heads, by\\n  bounding the lower and upper transaction validity time of the `close`\\n  transaction. As always, time handling is hard and this required detailed\\n  discussion in the form of an ADR. See\\n  [ADR21](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/adr/21) for more details.\\n\\n- **Reduced cost of commits** by at least **30%** using reference scripts also\\n  in the `commit` transaction. We only used reference scripts in `abort` so far.\\n  This reduces the min ADA cost of `commit` because the transactions are roughly\\n  5.2KB smaller.\\n\\n  Before:\\n  ![](./img/2022-12-commit.png)\\n\\n  After:\\n  ![](./img/2022-12-commit-new.png)\\n  \\n- **Use nix flakes & build docker images using nix**: Triggered by a migration\\n  to Cicero for a nix-based CI, we started using nix flakes for `nix build` and\\n  `nix develop` instead of the legacy `nix-shell` in\\n  [#646](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/646). While we ended up\\n  sticking with Github Actions as the only CI and a Cachix cache, we extended\\n  this work to build our docker images more efficiently using `nix` in\\n  [#654](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/654).\\n\\n  Image sizes went down between 20-50%:\\n\\n  ![](./img/2022-12-docker-images.png)\\n  \\n  While docker CI builds on `master` went down to 1-10min (from 10-30m+)!\\n\\n## Hydra V1 Specification\\n\\nFinally, we bit the bullet and started a write-up of the specification. Over the\\nlast couple of months we had worked with marked up versions (see below) of the\\noriginal paper and a GDoc to discuss and review the protocol as it was\\nimplemented.\\n\\n\\n![](./img/2022-12-marked-up-paper.png)\\n  \\nAs we also updated the security properties and proofs, we started aggregating a\\nLaTeX document on overleaf. While it holds a similar background and\\npreliminaries as the original paper, it only specifies a single version of the\\nprotocol with no variants, less modularization, as well as explicit assumptions\\nand important notes for implementors.\\n  \\n![](./img/2022-12-spec-overleaf.png)\\n\\nWe aim to be publishing the spec as part of the main [hydra repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra) soon.\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n- **Hydra for Payments project** completed the first phase of this work stream\\n  by tagging version [0.1.0](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/hydra-pay/releases/tag/v0.1.0).\\n  This open source project conducted by Obsidian Systems and sponsored by IOG\\n  created a great starting point for developers to build services/APIs of\\n  payment channels using Hydra Head. This month we reviewed the improved\\n  documentation and are looking forward to see this work applied to eventually\\n  build fast & cheap payments for light-wallet users and power payment channel\\n  use cases from business-to-business (B2B) in the short-term.\\n\\n- **Hydra for Voting project** kicked off this joint project between IOG\\n  Research, Catalyst & Hydra Tribes, and the Cardano Foundation. The goal is to\\n  assess suitability of Hydra Head to support voting use cases by implementing\\n  parts of Catalyst voting system on Hydra Head and benchmark execution at\\n  scale. The kick-off meeting took place on December 15.\\n    \\n- **Blog post by CF**: To round off the year, Matthias wrote a nice\\n  [retrospective blog\\n  post](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/hydra-head-protocol-an-open-source-solution-for-scalability/)\\n  about Hydra at the CF. Besides summarizing our progress made in 2022 it also\\n  gives an outlook where Hydra is headed for in 2023.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAlthough Hydra is in essence an open source project right now, we would love to\\nmake it \\"even more open source\\" in the coming months. Our vision of Hydra\\nrequires to have the builders of the Cardano ecosystem to be part of this\\njourney. For that matter, we want not only to open up these monthly reports, but\\nthe review meeting backing it as well!\\n\\nThis, besides our engagements with the community above, will allow the project\\nto grow beyond IOG & CF contributions. To become the true Cardano open source\\nproject we believe will be worthy to serve as the scalability component required\\nby the Cardano network."},{"id":"2022-11","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2022-11","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/master/docs/monthly/2022-11-monthly.md","source":"@site/monthly/2022-11-monthly.md","title":"November 2022","description":"Introduction","date":"2022-12-05T09:19:28.000Z","formattedDate":"5 d\xe9cembre 2022","tags":[{"label":"monthly","permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/tags/monthly"}],"readingTime":8.5,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Nagel","title":"Software Engineering Lead - Hydra @ IOG","url":"https://github.com/ch1bo","imageURL":"https://github.com/ch1bo.png","key":"ch1bo"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"November 2022","slug":"2022-11","authors":"ch1bo","tags":["monthly"]},"prevItem":{"title":"December 2022","permalink":"/head-protocol/fr/monthly/2022-12"}},"content":"## Introduction\\n\\nThis report summarizes the activities of the Hydra team since October 2022 and also serves as a preparation & write-up of the monthly review meeting, in which we update major stakeholders of the project on recent developments and gather their feedback on our proposed plan forward each month.\\n\\n## Roadmap update\\n\\nLooking at our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21) we can report the following releases and updates:\\n\\n#### Release `0.8.0`\\n\\n- Long overdue feature release adding persistence to the hydra-node\\n- Backup & restore the state of a Hydra Head [#187](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/187)\\n- Improve user experience following hydraw experiment [#518](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/518) from being only a discussion to a (to-be-groomed & planned) feature\\n- [Full release notes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/releases/tag/0.8.0)\\n\\n#### Release `0.8.1`\\n\\n- Follow-up release addressing user feedback on persistence from `0.8.0`\\n- Allow clients to see latest state after restart [#580](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/580)\\n- Bug fixes of following chain state [#599](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/599)\\n- [Full release notes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/releases/tag/0.8.1)\\n\\n#### Notable changes\\n\\n- Impact mapping from workshop (see below) and reviewing the starmap above had us discuss whether the scope for `1.0.0` is correct or not\\n- Need to be conscious of scope creep vs. getting something audited\\n- Focus on getting the spec done, `0.9.0` tagged and an audit under way now \u2192 minor re-ordering in priorities\\n- Iterative releases afterwards still - even while getting audited, non-contract changes first\\n- Promoted [https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/635](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/635) from being only a discussion to a (to-be-groomed & planned) feature\\n\\n![](./img/2022-11-roadmap.png)\\n<small><center>\\nLatest roadmap with 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 already released and slight re-ordering on 0.9.0\\n\\n</center></small>\\n\\n## Development\\n\\nIssues closed since last report: [Issues - input-output-hk/hydra](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc+closed%3A%3E%3D2022-10-19)\\n\\nBesides the things in the releases above (see roadmap update), we have\\nbeen working on:\\n\\n- **Flaky TUI CI tests:** We have sunk quite some time again in\\n  investigating cryptic CI failures in our TUI end-to-end tests. They\\n  have been crashing abruptly without any information and thus\\n  hard-to-debug. This investigation was unsuccessful and we realized\\n  at some point that the TUI tests are not that important anyways - we\\n  have API-level end-to-end tests. So we disabled these tests for now.\\n\\n- **Published** `hydra-cardano-api` **to CHaP:** With the Cardano\\n  Haskell Packages (CHaP) becoming available now and wanting to be a\\n  good citizen, we pushed for getting our flavor of the `cardano-api`\\n  also published there. This is non-trivial though, as we are at an\\n  integration point even \\"further up\\" than the `cardano-node`\\n  [#504](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/504)\\n\\n- **Implemented ADR18:** While the first stints on persistence already\\n  make it possible to restart `hydra-node` without needing to close a\\n  Head, we have implemented this in a nicer way now only keeping a\\n  single state (ground truth) for both L2 and L1 information\\n  [#541](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/541) of the Head protocol and the specification, we kept\\n  discovering bigger and bigger issues and hence realized the need for\\n  a discussion on transaction validity in context of closing /\\n  contesting Heads. [#615](#615)\\n\\n## Formal verification & specification\\n\\nAn important part of the project right now is the formalization and\\naudit preparation:\\n\\n- **Internal audit** has started with involvement of two persons from IOG IT\\n  team, each one addressing different part of Hydra:\\n\\n  - One auditor is working on the project as a whole, targeting\\n    potential vulnerabilities with the off-chain code, the\\n    infrastructure, dependencies, etc. This has not lead to any\\n    significant issue nor action plan so far.\\n  - Another auditor is specifically targeting the formal\\n    specification and the on-chain code to identify vulnerabilities\\n    in the protocol itself.\\n\\n- Discussions with researchers have led to the development of a joint Coordinated Hydra Head V1 specification defining formally the protocol as it is actually implemented.\\n\\n  - Work on this document has already allowed us to identify gaps\\n  - It is the basis on which BCryptic\'s analyst is working to audit Hydra protocol\\n  - It allows us to make explicit a lot of implicit assumptions that are in the code but not in the original paper and \\"Shape\\" the language used to describe the protocol\\n\\n- We have drafted an RFP for submission to **external** auditors\\n  [https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/audit/rfp/security/RFP.md](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/audit/rfp/security/RFP.md) defining the scope and targets of the audit\\n\\n- We are still unsure about whether our **approach** is the right one as having a \\"formal specification\\" in a manually checked document spanning a dozen pages seems quite brittle.\\n\\n  - Some progress has been made on \\"formalizing\\" properties to be automatically \\"QuickChecked\\" using an executable model of the expected behavior of the system but this approach seems more suited for \\"team-internal consumption\\", e.g. building confidence within the core committers and contributors\\n\\n  - Ideally, we would want a proper formalization of the protocol, using an existing theorem proving/model checking framework, through which properties could be asserted. Quite a lot of work has already been done in blockchain space, including some work on Lightning and TLA+ or some other state-machine/temporal logic based language appear promising:\\n\\n    - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wecVT_4QDcU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wecVT_4QDcU)\\n    - [https://github.com/rberenguel/tla_lightning](https://github.com/rberenguel/tla_lightning)\\n    - [https://www.amazon.com/Practical-TLA-Planning-Driven-Development/dp/1484238281](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-TLA-Planning-Driven-Development/dp/1484238281)\\n\\n  - This effort should be done in accordance to the DApps certification process\\n\\n## Product\\n\\nMost updates on the product side of things have been addressed in the\\nstarmap update above.\\n\\n- **Hydra for Payments lighthouse project**: Latest demonstration\\n  shown by Obsidian Systems on how to use payment channels in a \\"light\\n  way\\" from a web frontend. The API evolved and we were able to use\\n  the `preview` testnet now. The project is progressing very nicely\\n  and we are optimistic to close it successfully soon with improved\\n  documentation and usability.\\n\\n- **NFT auctions lighthouse project:** After doing surveys and\\n  interviews, MLabs is currently concluding the discovery phase with a\\n  light / white paper on how NFT auctions could be implemented using\\n  Hydra (today or in the future with more features).\\n\\n- **Drafting Voting on Hydra project**: Work has started on building a\\n  Proof-of-concept for voting on Hydra targeting Catalyst\u2019s use case but with an eye towards building a generic solution suitable for large scale voting systems based on Hydra Head\\n\\n  This development should be undertaken jointly with the Cardano Foundation and SundaeSwap who are also interested in building such a system and recently demonstrated their capacity of doing voting via the Cardano Summit voting system.\\n\\n- **TxPipe demonstrated integration with demeter.run:** Without our\\n  help nor even knowing of this effort, TxPipe has recently shown an\\n  early prototype of `hydra-node`s instrumented via their\\n  [demeter.run](https://demeter.run) platform. This has come a bit as a surprise and is exactly why we love open source :heart: \u2192 [Video](https://www.loom.com/share/c811360e60084f18ab9e9f16cc941432)\\n\\n## Team & open source\\n\\nSome notable developments this month have been:\\n\\n- **Renamed the repository:** from **hydra-poc** to\\n  [**hydra**](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra)! This was revealed in the summit presentation (see below) and should indicate that the project is not only a Proof of Concept (POC) anymore, but has become more - as also demonstrated by the various early adopters and demos lately. :dragon_face:\\n\\n- **Inner source (IOG) contribution:** The education team has been working on a Hydra Tutorial and we have been involved in reviewing and trying it out. This is a great effort and will help people get started with Hydra. Thanks folks :green_heart:\\n\\n## Cardano Summit & workshop\\n\\nThis month there was also the Cardano Summit, this time organized by the\\nCardano Foundation and the content was even voted on by the community!\\nWe have been both, invited and nominated as panelist and speakers and\\nthis makes us extremely proud! In general, the reception of Hydra seems\\nto be very positive in the community from what we could experience first\\nhand on the summit.\\n\\nAgenda items we participated in:\\n\\n- [Best of blockchain, best of open source - Open Source panel ](https://summit.cardano.org/agenda-day-1/best-of-blockchain-best-of-open-source/) with IOG, CF & TxPipe\\n\\n- [Cardano Ballot Speaker Winner: Dev Team](https://summit.cardano.org/agenda-day-2/cardano-ballot-speaker-winner-presentation-6/) Introduction to Hydra and\\n  reveal of the repository rename \ud83c\udf89\\n\\nAfter attending the summit, we also used the fact that the whole team is\\nin one location for a team workshop. We booked a coworking space and\\nspent 3 days together. Not much coding & hacking this time, but we are\\nhappy to have produced these results:\\n\\n- **Timeline / year in review:** As we had new team members with us,\\n  the request was to give a recap of how the Hydra project evolved\\n  over the last two years. The whole timeline can bee seen below, and\\n  this also sparked the idea of creating a \\"Year in review\\" blog post,\\n  which is currently in preparation.\\n\\n- **Retrospective**: In-person workshops are the perfect place for\\n  doing retrospectives to reflect on what was good, bad and collecting\\n  ideas & actions in how to improve our work environment and\\n  processes.\\n\\n  ![](./img/2022-11-retro.png)\\n  <small><center>\\n  Retrospective board from 2022-11-22\\n  </center></small>\\n\\n- **Impact map:** Conscious about the fact that the project got defined about one year ago in a first project plan, and inspired by timeline and (short-term) ideas, we also set off to reflect on the **Why**, **How** and **What** of this project.\\n\\n  After reviewing the project vision, we reached for the tool of our choice to ideate on tangible objectives / deliverables - impact maps! Also, we felt the need to use a different goal this time. One that is reflecting more closely (or, in fact, broadly) what our current mission is. So instead of the **% of Cardano transactions are done on L2**, we set a new goal: being the **number one DApp on Cardano** (by all known metrics: TVL, traffic, volume etc..) Fundamentally, both goals illustrate the same idea, but the latter better supports the narrative that Hydra is also just a DApp (not a network upgrade) and needs usage & adoption to reach our vision.\\n\\n  Below you see the result of our session. We checked back to the old impact map after creating this one, and many things are still relevant / similar on the new sample (it\'s never complete!) - some of the deliverables we even achieved.\\n\\n  ![](./img/2022-11-impact.png)\\n  <small><center>\\n  Impact map with new goal\\n  </center></small>\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nReflecting on our original plans (about a year ago) and our current roadmap we can say we are behind our anticipated schedule. However, recent developments on the lighthouse projects and community members contributing & using Hydra are convincing us that we are on the right track. The summit paints a similar picture and we feel reinvigorated by the great people we met, discussions we had and relationships we created & solidified on the summit and during our Hydra workshop."}]}')}}]);
