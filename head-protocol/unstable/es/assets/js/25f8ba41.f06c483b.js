In both cases, the `CurrencySymbol == HeadId`\\n* Our scripts become simpler as we only need to check that ST/PT are paid forward, instead of needing to check datums\\n* The datum produced by `commit` txs (and consumed by `collectCom`) is `Just SerializedTxOut`, which is simpler than also keeping the participant which committed in the datum (compare to full life-cycle of [0.3.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/0.3.0/docs/images/on-chain-full.jpg)).\\n\\n* The `v_head` script validator does not need to be parameterized, which makes discovering new Heads (and also tracking them for metrics) easier as the address to watch for is common to all Heads (of the same `v_head` version).\\n* The `v_head` script (path) for the abort life-cycle can be implemented already much safer by checking that all PTs are burned on the `abort` transaction (counting inputs in abort life-cycle of [0.3.0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/tree/0.3.0/docs/images/on-chain-abort.jpg)).\\n* Updated diagrams for the [full](img/on-chain-full.jpg) and [abort](img/on-chain-abort.jpg) on-chain life-cycles of a Hydra Head.\\n\\n## Follow-up questions\\n\\n* What value does the `ST` actually add?

Hence it would not be enough to just persist all the `Event`s and replaying them to achieve persistence, nor resetting to some previous `HeadState` in the presence of a rollback.\\n\\n## Decision\\n\\n* We define and keep a \\"blackbox\\" `ChainStateType tx` in the `HeadState tx`\\n  - It shall not be introspectable to the business logic in `HeadLogic`\\n  - It shall contain chain-specific information about the current Hydra Head, which will naturally need to evolve once we have multiple Heads in our feature scope\\n  - For example:\\n  ```hs\\n  data HeadState tx\\n    = IdleState\\n    | InitialState\\n        { chainState :: ChainStateType tx\\n        -- ...\\n        }\\n    | OpenState\\n        { chainState :: ChainStateType tx\\n        -- ...\\n        }\\n    | ClosedState\\n        { chainState :: ChainStateType tx\\n        -- ...\\n        }\\n  ```\\n* We provide the latest `ChainStateType tx` to `postTx`:\\n  ```hs\\n  postTx :: ChainStateType tx -> PostChainTx tx -> m ()\\n  ```\\n* We change the `ChainEvent tx` data type and callback interface of `Chain` to:\\n  ```hs\\n  data ChainEvent tx\\n    = Observation\\n        { observedTx :: OnChainTx tx\\n        , newChainState :: ChainStateType tx\\n        }\\n    | Rollback ChainSlot\\n    | Tick UTCTime\\n\\n  type ChainCallback tx m = (ChainStateType tx -> Maybe (ChainEvent tx)) -> m ()\\n  ```\\nwith the meaning, that invocation of the callback indicates receival of a transaction which is `Maybe` observing a relevant `ChainEvent tx`, where an `Observation` may include a `newChainState`.\\n* We also decide to extend `OnChainEffect` with a `ChainState tx` to explicitly\\n  thread the used `chainState` in the `Hydra.HeadLogic`.\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\n* We need to change the construction of `Chain` handles and the call sites of `postTx`\\n* We need to extract the state handling (similar to the event queue) out of the `HydraNode` handle and shuffle the main of `hydra-node` a bit to be able to provide the latest `ChainState` to the chain callback as a continuation.\\n* We need to make the `ChainState` serializable (`ToJSON`, `FromJSON`) as it will be part of the `HeadState`.\\n* We can drop the `TVar` of keeping `OnChainHeadState` in the `Hydra.Chain.Direct` module.\\n* We need to update `DirectChainSpec` and `BehaviorSpec` test suites to mock/implement the callback & state handling.\\n* We might be able to simplify the `ChainState tx` to be just a `UTxOType tx` later.\\n* As `OnChainEffect` and `Observation` values will contain a `ChainStateType tx`, traces will automatically include the full `ChainState`, which might be helpful but also possible big. \\n\\n## Alternative\\n\\n* We could extend `PostChainTx` (like `Observation`) with `ChainState` and keep the signatures:\\n```hs\\npostTx :: MonadThrow m => PostChainTx tx -> m ()\\ntype ChainCallback tx m = (ChainState tx -> Maybe (ChainEvent tx) -> m ()\\n```\\n  - Not implemented as it is less clear on the need for a `ChainState` in the signatures."},{"id":"19","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/unstable/es/adr/19","source":"@site/adr/2022-07-22_019-reference-scripts.md","title":"19.

That means, it should support the same transaction formats and (if desired) use the same ledger rules as the layer 1.\\n\\n* Cardano is our layer 1 and its consensus layer separates time into discrete steps, where each step is called a `Slot`. The network is expected to evolve strictly monotonically on this time scale and so slot numbers (`SlotNo`) are always increasing.\\n\\n* The Cardano mainnet has a block scheduled every 20 seconds, although it may take longer.\\n  - This is because `slotLength = 1.0` and every 20th slot is \\"active\\" with `f = 0.05`.\\n  - The consensus protocol requires `k` blocks to be produced within `3k/f` slots, where `k = 2160` on mainnet.\\n\\n* Transactions on Cardano may have a validity range with a lower and upper bound given as `SlotNo`.\\n\\n* Wall-clock time can be converted to slots (and back) using an `EraHistory` or `EpochInterpreter` provided by the consensus layer of the cardano node. This is required as the slot lengths could change over time.\\n  - All past points in time since the `SystemStart` can be converted.\\n  - Future points in time can **only** be converted in the \\"safe zone\\", practically being at least `3k/f` slots (TODO: cross check). Refer to chapter 17 *Time* on the [consensus spec](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/16997794/download/1/report.pdf) for more details.\\n\\n* The Hydra Head protocol allows `close` and `contest` transactions only up before a deadline `T_final`, and `fanout` transactions after the deadline.\\n  - In the current implementation the deadline is upper validity of `closed` plus the contestation period.\\n  - We also consider protocol variants which push out the deadline by the contestation period on each `contest`.\\n  - Contestation periods may very well be longer than the stability window of the protocol. For example: 7 days, while the mainnet stability window is more like 36 hours.\\n\\n* We have encountered two problems with handling time in the past\\n  - Trying to convert wall-clock time to slots of the Head protocol deadline led to `PastHorizonException` (when using very low security parameter `k`)\\n  - Trying to `fanout` after the deadline, but before another block has been seen by the L1 ledger led to `OutsideValidityIntervalUTxO`.\\n  \\n* The second problem scenario and solution ideas are roughly visible on this whiteboard:\\n\\n![](img/020-timing-fanout.jpg)\\n\\n## Decision\\n\\n* The head logic uses wall-clock time to track time and only convert to/from slots when constructing/observing transactions in the chain layer.\\n  - This ensures that transactions we post or see on the chain can be converted to/from slots.\\n  - The head logic would use `UTCTime` for points in time and `NominalDiffTime` for durations.\\n  - The chain layer converts these using the `SystemStart` and `EraHistory` into `SlotNo`.\\n\\n* The chain layer informs the logic layer whenever time passed (on the chain) using a new `Tick` event.\\n  - For the direct chain implementation, this is whenever we see a block in the chain sync protocol.\\n  - Per above decision, the `Tick` shall contain a `UTCTime` corresponding to the new \\"now\\" as seen through the block chain.\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\n* Conversion from `UTCTime -> SlotNo` and vice versa stays local to the chain layer.\\n\\n* The `HeadLogic` can track chain time in its state and condition `ReadyToFanout` upon seeing it pass the deadline.\\n  - Ensures clients only see `ReadyToFanout` when a following `Fanout` would be really possible.\\n  - Makes the `Delay` effect redundant and we can remove it (only delay via reenqueue on the `Wait` outcome)\\n\\n* By introducing `Tick` events, `IOSim` will not be able to detect non-progress (deadlocks).\\n  - This means we cannot rely on early exit of simulations anymore and need to determine meaningful simulation endings instead of `waitUntilTheEndOfTime`.\\n\\n* We get a first, rough notion of time for free in our L2 and can support \\"timed transactions\\" with same resolution as the L1.\\n  - Tracking time in the state makes it trivial to provide it to the ledger when we `applyTransaction`.\\n  - Of course we could extend the fidelity of this feature using the system clock for \\"dead reckoning\\" between blocks. The conversion of wall clock to slot could even be configurable using an L2 `slotLength` analogous to L1 (although we might not want/need this)."},{"id":"21","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/unstable/es/adr/21","source":"@site/adr/2022-12-05_021-Bounded-transaction-validity-on-Hydra-protocol-transactions.md","title":"21.

This was also required so far to compute the\\n  contestation deadline.\\n\\n- Different networks (chains) have different slot lenghts, e.g. the preview\\n  network has a slot every `1s`, while our local devnets use `0.1s`. This means\\n  hardcoded values like `closeGraceTime` need to be _in sync_ with the\\n  underlying network.\\n\\n- The `contestationPeriod` can be configured by users via the `Init` client\\n  input. For example, the hydra-cluster test suite uses a hardcoded `cperiod` on\\n  the client side.\\n\\n- Default value for `T_Min` is negative infinity.\\n\\n- Lower tx validity being in the future does not pose a problem since other\\n  participant is able to close a head.\\n\\n#### What we want to achieve:\\n\\n- We want to enforce topmost formula in this file in our code on-chain.\\n\\n- Introduce `maxGraceTime` expressed in seconds in place of `closeGraceTime` and adjust to\\n  appropriate value.\\n\\n- The contestation period is to be used to create bounded close transaction\\n  (together with `maxGraceTime`). Before it was only used for computing the\\n  contestation deadline.\\n\\n- [x] If contestation period is higher than `maxGraceTime` we will pick the\\n      latter. We still need `maxGraceTime` since if `contestationPeriod` is low for\\n      the current network our txs reach the upper bound fast and become invalid.\\n      That is why we set the upper tx bound to be minimum between\\n      `contestationPeriod` and `maxGraceTime` so that txs have high enough upper\\n      bound.\\n\\n- Make sure all head participants use the same value for `contestationPeriod`.\\n\\n- Attack vector has a corresponding mutation test.\\n\\n## Decision\\n\\n- Use the specification formula on-chain.\\n\\n- Configure the contestation period (number of seconds) on the `hydra-node`,\\n  e.g. via a `--contestation-period` command line option.\\n\\n- Lower tx bound should be the last known slot as reported by the\\n  `cardano-node`.\\n\\n- Upper tx bound is the current time + minimum between `contestationPeriod` and\\n  `maxGraceTime`.\\n\\n- When submitting the `InitTx` make sure to use `--contestation-period` value\\n  from our node\'s flag.\\n\\n- If other nodes observe `OnInitTx` and the `contestationPeriod` value does not\\n  match with their `--contestation-period` setting - ignore `InitTx`.\\n\\n- Rename `closeGraceTime` to `maxGraceTime` since we are using it also for upper\\n  bound of a contest tx.\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\n- Not any positive number of seconds is a valid contestation period any more!\\n\\n- Upper tx validity of close transaction is the minimum between `maxGraceTime`\\n  and `contestationPeriod` and this needs to be _good enough_ value with respect\\n  to running network.

While this is a straightforward strategy to implement, it has a huge impact on the performance of a Hydra Head as serialising a large data structure like the `HeadState` and completely overwriting a file is costly\\n  - We revisited our benchmarks and [found](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/186#issuecomment-1584292265) that persistence was the major bottleneck when measuring roundtrip confirmation time,e g. the time it takes from a client\'s perspective to submit a transaction and observe in a `ConfirmedSnapshot`\\n- Furthermore, the way we currently handle changes to the `HeadState` in the hydra-node, while conceptually being an `Effect` is handled differently from other `Effect`s: The state is updated transactionally through a dedicated `modifyHeadState` function in the core loop of processing events, and _then_ effects are processed.\\n\\n## Decision\\n\\nImplement state persistence using [_Event Sourcing_](https://thinkbeforecoding.com/post/2013/07/28/Event-Sourcing-vs-Command-Sourcing). Practically, this means:\\n\\n1. Replace the `NewState` outcome with a `StateChanged` _event_ which can be part of the `Outcome` of `HeadLogic`\'s `update` function, representing the _change_ to be applied to the current state.\\n2. Add an `aggregate` function to manage applying `StateChanged` events on top of the current `HeadState` to keep it updated in-memory.\\n3. Persist `StateChanged`s in an append-only log using a dedicated [handle](/adr/4).\\n4. Upon node startup, reread `StateChanged` events log and reapply those to reset the `HeadState`.\\n\\nThe following sequence diagram illustrates new event handling in the `HeadLogic`:\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n   Node ->> Node : nextEvent : event\\n   critical modifyHeadState : state -> state\';\\n     activate Node\\n     Node ->>+ HeadLogic: update(state, event)\\n     HeadLogic --\x3e>- Node : Outcome (sc: StateChanged, oe: OtherEffect)\\n     Node ->>+ HeadLogic: aggregate(state, sc)\\n     HeadLogic --\x3e- Node : state\'\\n   end\\n   deactivate Node\\n   Node ->> Persistence: append(sc)\\n   Node ->> Node: processEffect(oe)\\n```\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\n- :racehorse: The main expected consequence of this change is an increase of the overall performance of Hydra Head network.\\n\\n- Need to pattern match twice on the `HeadState`, once in `update` and once in `aggregate`.\\n\\n- Terms from the specification are distributed over `update` and `aggregate` function. For example, the statements about updating all seen transactions would now be in `aggregate` and not anymore in `update`.\\n\\n- New possibilities this change introduces with respect to `ServerOutput` handling and client\'s access to a head\'s state:\\n\\n  - Instead of having the `HeadLogic` emits directly a `ClientEffect`, the latter could be the result of a client-centric _interpretation_ of a `StateChanged`.\\n  - Pushing this a little further, we could maintain a _Query Model_ for clients with a dedicated [Query API](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/686) to ease implementation of stateless clients.\\n\\n- Calling `StateChanged` an _event_ while treating it in the code alongside _effects_ might introduce some confusion as we already use the word [Event](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/45913954eb18ef550a31017daa443cee6720a00c/hydra-node/src/Hydra/HeadLogic.hs#L64) to designate the inputs (a.k.a. commands) to the Head logic state machine.

(not addressed in this ADR though,\\n    relevant discussion\\n    [#797](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions/797))\\n\\n  - As [ADR-15](/adr/15) also proposes, some clients may not need (or should\\n    not have) access to administrative information.\\n\\n- It is often a good idea to separate the responsibilities of Commands and\\n  Queries ([CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)), as well as the model they use.\\n\\n## Decision\\n\\n- Drop `GetUTxO` and `GetUTxOResponse` messages as they advocate a\\n  request/response way of querying.\\n\\n- Realize that `ClientInput` data is actually a `ClientCommand` (renaming them)\\n  and that `ServerOutput` are just `projections` of the [internal event stream\\n  (see ADR-24)](/adr/24) into read `models` on the API layer.\\n\\n- Compose a versioned (`/v1`) API out of resource `models`, which\\n  compartmentalize the domain into topics on the API layer.\\n\\n  - A resource has a `model` type and the _latest_ value is the result of a pure\\n    `projection` folded over the `StateChanged` event stream, i.e. `project :: model -> StateChanged -> model`.\\n\\n  - Each resource is available at some HTTP path, also called \\"endpoint\\":\\n\\n    - `GET` requests must respond with the _latest_ state in a single response.\\n\\n    - `GET` requests with `Upgrade: websocket` headers must start a websocket\\n      connection, push the _latest_ state as first message and any resource\\n      state updates after.\\n\\n    - Other HTTP verbs may be accepted by a resource handler, i.e. to issue\\n      resource-specific _commands_. Any commands accepted must also be available\\n      via the corresponding websocket connection.\\n\\n  - `Accept` request headers can be used to configure the `Content-Type` of the\\n    response\\n\\n    - All resources must provide `application/json` responses\\n\\n    - Some resources might support more content types (e.g. CBOR-encoded binary)\\n\\n  - Query parameters may be used to further configure responses of some\\n    resources. For example, `?address=<bech32>` could be used to filter UTxO by\\n    some address.\\n\\n- Keep the semantics of `/`, which accepts websocket upgrade connections and\\n  sends direct/raw output of `ServerOutput` events on `/`, while accepting all\\n  `ClientCommand` messages.\\n\\n  - Define `ServerOutput` also in terms of the `StateChanged` event stream\\n\\n### Example resources\\n\\nExample resource paths + HTTP verbs mapped to existing things to demonstrate the\\neffects of the decision points above. The mappings may change and are to be\\ndocumented by an API specification instead.\\n\\n| Path                             | GET                            | POST                   | PATCH   | DELETE             |\\n| :------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :--------------------- | ------- | :----------------- |\\n| `/v1/head/status`                | `HeadStatus(..)`               | -                      | -       | -                  |\\n| `/v1/head/snapshot/utxo`         | last confirmed snapshot utxo   | -                      | -       | -                  |\\n| `/v1/head/snapshot/transactions` | confirmed snapshot txs         | `NewTx` + responses    | -       | -                  |\\n| `/v1/head/ledger/utxo`           | `localUTxO`                    | -                      | -       | -                  |\\n| `/v1/head/ledger/transactions`   | `localTxs`                     | `NewTx` + responses    | -       | -                  |\\n| `/v1/head/commit`                | -                              | `Chain{draftCommitTx}` | -       | -                  |\\n| `/v1/head`                       | all `/v1/head/*` data          | `Init`                 | `Close` | `Fanout` / `Abort` |\\n| `/v1/protocol-parameters`        | current protocol parameters    |                        |         |                    |\\n| `/v1/cardano-transaction`        | -                              | `Chain{submitTx}`      | -       | -                  |\\n| `/v1/peers`                      | a list of peers                | -                      | -       | -                  |\\n| `/v1/node-version`               | node version as in `Greetings` | -                      | -       | -                  |\\n| `/v1/`                           | all `/v1/*` data               | -                      | -       | -                  |\\n\\nMultiple heads are out of scope now and hence paths are not including a\\n`<headId>` variable section.\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\n- Clear separation of what types are used for querying and gets subscribed to by\\n  clients and we have dedicated types for sending data to clients\\n\\n- Changes on the querying side of the API are separated from the business logic.\\n\\n- Clients do not need to aggregate data that is already available on the server\\n  side without coupling the API to internal state representation.\\n\\n- Separation of Head operation and Head usage, e.g. some HTTP endpoints can be\\n  operated with authentication.\\n\\n- Clients have a fine-grained control over what to subscribe to and what to\\n  query.\\n\\n- Versioned API allows clients to detect incompatibility easily.\\n\\n- Need to rewrite how the `hydra-tui` is implemented."},{"id":"27","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/unstable/es/adr/27","source":"@site/adr/2023-09-08_027-network-resilience.md","title":"27.

Our system lies in the [CP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) space of the landscape mapped by the CAP theorem.\\n\\nWe have identified 3 main sources of failures in the _fail-recovery_ model that can lead to a head being stuck:\\n\\n1. The network layer can drop messages from the moment a node `broadcast`s it, leading to some messages not being received at the other end\\n2. The sending node can crash in between the moment the state is changed (and persisted) and the moment a message is actually sent through the network (or even when it calls `broadcast`)\\n3. The receiving node can crash in between the moment the message has been received in the network layer, and it\'s processed (goes through the queue)\\n\\nWe agree that we\'ll want to address all those issues in order to provide a good user experience, as not addressing 2. and 3. can lead to hard to troubleshoot issues with heads. We have not experienced those issues yet as they would probably only crop up under heavy loads, or in the wild. But we also agree we want to tackle 1. first because it\'s where most of the risk lies. By providing a _Reliable Broadcast_ layer, we will significantly reduce the risks and can then later on address the other points.\\n\\nTherefore, the scope of this ADR is to address only point 1. above: Ensure broadcast messages are eventually received by all peers, given the sender does not stop before.\\n\\n### Discussion\\n\\n* We are currently using the [ouroboros-framework](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network) and [typed-protocols](https://github.com/input-output-hk/typed-protocols) network stack as a mere [transport](https://osi-model.com/transport-layer/) layer.\\n  * Being built on top of TCP, ouroboros multiplexer (Mux) provides the same reliability guarantees, plus the multiplexing capabilities of course\\n  * It also takes care of reconnecting to peers when a failure is detected which relieves us from doing so, but any reconnection implies a reset of each peer\'s state machine which means we need to make sure any change to the state of pending/received messages is handled by the applicative layer\\n  * Our [FireForget protocol](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/8a8e0829964132bde8949e5249a1ab303af92fb8/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Network/Ouroboros/Type.hs#L31) ignores connections/disconnections\\n  * Ouroboros/typed-protocols provides enough machinery to implement a reliable broadcast protocol, for example by reusing existing `[KeepAlive](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/tree/master/ouroboros-network-protocols/src/Ouroboros/Network/Protocol/KeepAlive)` protocol and building a more robust point-to-point protocol than what we have now\\n  * There is a minor limitation, namely that the subscription mechanism does not handle connections invidually, but as a set of equivalent point-to-point full duplex connections whose size (valency) needs to be maintained at a certain threshold, which means that unless backed in the protocol itself, protocol state-machine and applications are not aware of the identity of the remote peer\\n* We have built our `Network` infrastructure over the concept of relatively independent layers, each implementing a similar interface with different kind of messages, to `broadcast` messages to all peers and be notified of incoming messages through a `callback`.\\n  * This pipes-like abstraction allows us to compose our network stack like:\\n\\n    ```\\n     withAuthentication (contramap Authentication tracer) signingKey otherParties $\\n      withHeartbeat nodeId connectionMessages $\\n        withOuroborosNetwork (contramap Network tracer) localhost peers\\n    ```\\n\\n  * This has the nice property that we can basically swap the lower layers should we need to, for example to use [UDP](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/abailly-iohk/multi-node-udp/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Network/UDP.hs), or add other layers for example to address specific head instances in presence of [multiple heads](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/abailly-iohk/multi-node-udp/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Network/MultiHead.hs#L26)\\n\\n## Decision\\n\\n* We implement our own message tracking and resending logic as a standalone `Network` layer\\n* That layer consumes and produces `Authenticated msg` messages as it relies on identifying the source of messages\\n* It uses a vector of monotonically increasing _sequence numbers_ associated with each party (including itself) to track what are the last messages from each party and to ensure FIFO delivery of messages\\n  * This _vector_ is used to identify peers which are lagging behind, resend the missing messages, or to drop messages which have already been received\\n  * The _Heartbeat_ mechanism is relied upon to ensure dissemination of state even when the node is quiescent\\n* We do not implement a _pull-based_ message communication mechanism as initially envisioned\\n* We do not persist messages either on the receiving or sending side at this time\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\n* We keep our existing `Network` interface hence all messages will be resent to all peers\\n  * This could be later optimized either by providing a smarter interface with a `send :: Peer -> msg -> m ()` unicast function, or by adding a layer with filtering capabilities, or both\\n* We want to specify this protocol clearly in order to ease implementation in other languages, detailing the structure of messages and the semantics of retries and timeouts.\\n* We may consider relying on the vector clock in the future to ensure perfect ordering of messages on each peer and make impossible for legit transactions to be temporarily seen as invalid. This can happen in the current version and is handled through wait and _TTL_"},{"id":"26","metadata":{"permalink":"/head-protocol/unstable/es/adr/26","source":"@site/adr/2023-09-08_026-stateless-observation-construction.md","title":"26.

Where a normal\\n  `Tx` will only contain `TxIn` information of its inputs, a `ResolvedTx` also\\n  includes the `TxOut` for each input.\\n\\n- Change `ChainSyncHandler` signature to `onRollForward :: BlockHeader -> [ResolvedTx] -> m ()`\\n\\n- Change observing function signature to `observeSomeTx :: ChainContext ->\\n  ResolvedTx -> Maybe (OnChainTx Tx)`. Notably there is no `ChainState`\\n  involved.\\n\\n- Do not guard observation by `HeadId` in the chain layer and instead do it in the `HeadLogic` layer.\\n\\n- Define a `SpendableUTxO` type that is a `UTxO` with potentially needed datums included.\\n\\n  - TBD: instead we could decide to use inline datums and rely on `UTxO` containing them\\n\\n- Change transaction creation functions `initialize`, `commit`, `abort`,\\n  `collect`, `close`, `contest` and `fanout` in `Hydra.Direct.Chain.State` to\\n  take `SpendableUTxO` and `HeadId`/`HeadParameters` as needed.\\n\\n- Extend `IsChainState` type class to enforce that it can be updated by\\n  concurrent transactions `update :: ChainStateType tx -> [tx] -> ChainStateType tx`.\\n\\n  - While this is not strictly needed \\"outside\\" of the chain layer, it will have\\n    us not fall into the same pit again.\\n\\n- Change `ChainStateAt` to only hold a `spendableUTxO` and the `recordedAt`.\\n\\n- Update the `LocalChainState` in `onRollForward` by using `update` and pushing\\n  a new `ChainStateAt` generically.\\n\\nTBD:\\n\\n- Impact on generators\\n\\n### Chain interface changes\\n\\n- Add `HeadId` and `HeadParameters` to `PostChainTx`.\\n- Add `HeadId` to all `OnChainTx` constructors.\\n- Extend `OnInitTx` with observed chain participants.\\n\\n  - TBD: How are _cardano_ verification keys generically represented in `HeadLogic`?\\n\\n- Extend `OnContestTx` with new deadline and a list of contesters.\\n- Move off-chain checks for what makes a \\"proper head\\" to `HeadLogic`\\n\\nTBD:\\n\\n- Merge `HeadSeed` and `HeadId`? How to abstract?\\n\\n## Consequences\\n\\n- All logic is kept in the logic layer and no protocol decisions (i.e. whether\\n  to adopt or ignore a head initialization) are taken in the chain layer.\\n\\n  - The `HeadLogic` gets informed of any proper `initTx` and can log that it is\\n    ignored and for what reason.\\n\\n- The transaction observation and construction functions can be moved into a\\n  dedicated package that is cardano-specific, but not requires special state\\n  knowledge of the \\"direct chain following\\" and can be re-used as a library.\\n\\n- All transaction observation functions used by `observeSomeTx` will need to be\\n  able to identify a Hydra Head transaction from only the `ResolvedTx` and the\\n  `ChainContext`\\n\\n- Any `Chain Tx` implementation wanting to re-use existing transaction\\n  observation functions must be able to resolve transaction inputs (against some\\n  ledger state) and produce `ResolvedTx`.\\n\\n  - A chain-following implementation (as `Hydra.Chain.Direct`) can keep previous\\n    transactions around.\\n  - A chain indexer on \\"interesting\\" protocol addresses can be used to\\n    efficiently query most inputs.\\n\\n- We can get rid of the `Hydra.Chain.Direct.State` glue code altogether.\\n\\n- While this does not directly supersede [ADR23](/adr/23), it paves the way to\\n  remove `LocalChainState` again as the `ChainStateAt` is now combinable from\\n  multiple transactions (see `update` above) and we can keep the state (again)\\n  only in the `HeadState` aggregate. Note that this would shift the rollback\\n  handling back into the logic layer."}]}')}}]);
