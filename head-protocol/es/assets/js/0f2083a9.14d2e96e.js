This makes it exceedingly hard to add an invalid transaction to the ledger, censor a new transaction from reaching the ledger, or contradict the existence and position of a stable transaction within the ledger. Furthermore, Cardano\u2019s Ouroboros consensus protocol is robust to nodes freely entering and leaving the network, as long as an honest majority of stake is maintained. However, Cardano mainnet has a high overhead of cost and latency, because every transaction and block must be broadcast, stored, and validated on every node across the world.\nThe Hydra Head protocol massively reduces this cost and latency overhead by distributing its ledger across a much smaller network of direct participants in the protocol and only tracking transactions that interact with a small subset of the mainnet UTxOs. However, it is up to the direct participants in the Hydra Head protocol to maintain the integrity of the ledger and all participants must unanimously agree on every transaction that gets added to the ledger. This means that anyone committing funds to a Hydra Head must either directly participate in the protocol or else effectively grant custody over the committed funds to the direct participants. It also means that no one can do anything in the Hydra Head without unanimous consent from the direct participants. Furthermore, the Hydra Head protocol requires all participants to be online and responsive to each other, or else it will stall its progress."),(0,a.kt)("h2",{id:"design"},"Design"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"We want the bidding experience to be lively and efficient, which is difficult to provide on L1, so we host the bidding process of our auction on L2. However, we can\u2019t have the bidders be direct participants in the Hydra Head, because it is impossible to get their unanimous consent on every bid since they are competing against each other in the auction.\nInstead, we define an independent group of delegates who will directly participate in the Hydra Head protocol on the seller's and bidders\u2019 behalf to witness the bids. These delegates perform a role similar to the combination of stakepool and lightwallet providers on Cardano L1.\nSince the bidders and seller are not direct participants in the Hydra Head, we do not commit any of the bidders\u2019 funds or the seller\u2019s NFT auction lot to the auction, because we do not want to grant the delegates custody over them. Instead, the Hydra Head is used purely to manage the informational aspect of the bidding process (Which bids were made? What is the current standing bid?). The auction lot and the bidders\u2019 funds remain on L1 at all times.\nSince the bidders\u2019 funds are not present on the Hydra Head ledger, there is no way to provide proof to validators on L2 that any bidder has sufficient funds committed to honoring his bid. Instead, we allow the seller to require that bidders place fixed security deposits into a smart contract on L1 towards the auction, such that the seller can claim the winning bidder\u2019s security deposit if the winning bid is dishonored, as compensation for wasting everyone\u2019s time.\nThe fixed deposit provides some protection to the seller against dishonorable behavior from bidders, but in some cases (e.g. if bids get unexpectedly high), it may still be advantageous to a bidder to dishonor his genuinely-placed bid or even to place a disingenuous bid to sabotage the auction. To feel comfortable selling an NFT in an auction with a fixed-size security deposit, the seller needs to be able to manage this risk. Furthermore, the seller may need to apply know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) processes to the auction.\nFor these reasons, we implement an invitational private version of the auction where the seller has absolute discretion over which bidders may participate in the auction.
